<p>After the abolition of the sh&#333;gunate and the resumption of
administrative functions by the Throne, one of the first acts
of the newly organized government was to invite
the foreign representatives to Ki&#333;to, where they
<span class="sidenote">Japan&rsquo;s Claim for Judicial Autonomy.</span>
had audience of the mikado. Subsequently a
decree was issued, announcing the emperor&rsquo;s
resolve to establish amicable relations with foreign countries,
and &ldquo;declaring that any Japanese subject thereafter guilty of
violent behaviour towards a foreigner would not only act in
opposition to the Imperial command, but would also be guilty
of impairing the dignity and good faith of the nation in the eyes
of the powers with which his majesty had pledged himself to
maintain friendship.&rdquo; From that time the relations between
Japan and foreign states grew yearly more amicable; the nation
adopted the products of Western civilization with notable
thoroughness, and the provisions of the treaties were carefully
observed. Those treaties, however, presented one feature
which very soon became exceedingly irksome to Japan. They
exempted foreigners residing within her borders from the
operation of her criminal laws, and secured to them the privilege
of being arraigned solely before tribunals of their own nationality.
That system had always been considered necessary
where the subjects of Christian states visited or sojourned in
non-Christian countries, and, for the purpose of giving effect to
it, consular courts were established. This necessitated the
confinement of foreign residents to settlements in the neighbourhood
of the consular courts, since it would have been imprudent
to allow foreigners to have free access to districts remote from
the only tribunals competent to control them. The Japanese
raised no objection to the embodiment of this system in the
treaties. They recognized its necessity and even its expediency,
for if, on the one hand, it infringed their country&rsquo;s sovereign
rights, on the other, it prevented complications which must
have ensued had they been entrusted with jurisdiction which
they were not prepared to discharge satisfactorily. But the
consular courts were not free from defects. A few of the
powers organized competent tribunals presided over by judicial
experts, but a majority of the treaty states, not having sufficiently
large interests at stake, were content to delegate consular
duties to merchants, not only deficient in legal training, but also
themselves engaged in the very commercial transactions upon
which they might at any moment be required to adjudicate in
a magisterial capacity. In any circumstances the dual functions
of consul and judge could not be discharged without anomaly by
the same official, for he was obliged to act as advocate in the
preliminary stages of complications about which, in his position
as judge, he might ultimately have to deliver an impartial
verdict. In practice, however, the system worked with tolerable
smoothness, and might have remained long in force had not the
patriotism of the Japanese rebelled bitterly against the implication
that their country was unfit to exercise one of the fundamental
attributes of every sovereign state, judicial autonomy.
From the very outset they spared no effort to qualify for the
recovery of this attribute. Revision of the country&rsquo;s laws and
reorganization of its law courts would necessarily have been
an essential feature of the general reforms suggested by contact
with the Occident, but the question of consular jurisdiction
certainly constituted a special incentive. Expert assistance
was obtained from France and Germany; the best features of
European jurisprudence were adapted to the conditions and
usages of Japan; the law courts were remodelled, and steps
were taken to educate a competent judiciary. In criminal law
the example of France was chiefly followed; in commercial law
that of Germany; and in civil law that of the Occident generally,
with due regard to the customs of the country. The jury
system was not adopted, collegiate courts being regarded as
more conducive to justice, and the order of procedure went
from tribunals of first instance to appeal courts and finally to
the court of cassation. Schools of law were quickly opened, and
a well-equipped bar soon came into existence. Twelve years
after the inception of these great works, Japan made formal
application for revision of the treaties on the basis of abolishing
consular jurisdiction. She had asked for revision in 1871,
sending to Europe and America an important embassy to raise
the question. But at that time the conditions originally calling
for consular jurisdiction had not undergone any change such
as would have justified its abolition, and the Japanese government,
though very anxious to recover tariff autonomy as well
as judicial, shrank from separating the two questions, lest by
prematurely solving one the solution of the other might be
unduly deferred. Thus the embassy failed, and though the
problem attracted great academical interest from the first, it
did not re-enter the field of practical politics until 1883. The
negotiations were long protracted. Never previously had an
Oriental state received at the hands of the Occident recognition
such as that now demanded by Japan, and the West naturally
felt deep reluctance to try a wholly novel experiment. The
United States had set a generous example by concluding a new
treaty (1878) on the lines desired by Japan. But its operation
was conditional on a similar act of compliance by the other
treaty powers. Ill-informed European publicists ridiculed the
Washington statesmen&rsquo;s attitude on this occasion, claiming that
what had been given with one hand was taken back with the
other. The truth is that the conditional provision was inserted
at the request of Japan herself, who appreciated her own unpreparedness
for the concession. From 1883, however, she was
ready to accept full responsibility, and she therefore asked that
all foreigners within her borders should thenceforth be subject to
her laws and judiciable by her law-courts, supplementing her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
application by promising that its favourable reception should
be followed by the complete opening of the country and the
removal of all restrictions hitherto imposed on foreign trade,
travel and residence in her realm. &ldquo;From the first it had been
the habit of Occidental peoples to upbraid Japan on account of
the barriers opposed by her to full and free foreign intercourse,
and she was now able to claim that these barriers were no longer
maintained by her desire, but that they existed because of a
system which theoretically proclaimed her unfitness for free
association with Western nations, and practically made it
impossible for her to throw open her territories completely
for the ingress of foreigners.&rdquo; She had a strong case, but on
the side of the European powers extreme reluctance was manifested
to try the unprecedented experiment of placing their
people under the jurisdiction of an Oriental country. Still
greater was the reluctance of those upon whom the experiment
would be tried. Foreigners residing in Japan naturally clung
to consular jurisdiction as a privilege of inestimable value.
They saw, indeed, that such a system could not be permanently
imposed on a country where the conditions justifying it had
nominally disappeared. But they saw, also, that the legal and
judicial reforms effected by Japan had been crowded into an
extraordinarily brief period, and that, as tyros experimenting
with alien systems, the Japanese might be betrayed into many
errors.</p>

<p>The negotiations lasted for eleven years. They were begun in
1883 and a solution was not reached until 1894. Finally European
governments conceded the justice of Japan&rsquo;s case,
and it was agreed that from July 1899 Japanese
<span class="sidenote">Recognition by the Powers.</span>
tribunals should assume jurisdiction over every
person, of whatever nationality, within the confines of Japan,
and the whole country should be thrown open to foreigners, all
limitations upon trade, travel and residence being removed.
Great Britain took the lead in thus releasing Japan from
the fetters of the old system. The initiative came from
her with special grace, for the system and all its irksome
consequences had been originally imposed on Japan by a
combination of powers with Great Britain in the van. As a
matter of historical sequence the United States dictated the
terms of the first treaty providing for consular jurisdiction. But
from a very early period the Washington government showed
its willingness to remove all limitations of Japan&rsquo;s sovereignty,
whereas Europe, headed by Great Britain, whose preponderating
interests entitled her to lead, resolutely refused to make any
substantial concession. In Japanese eyes, therefore, British
conservatism seemed to be the one serious obstacle, and since
the British residents in the settlements far outnumbered all other
nationalities, and since they alone had newspaper organs to
ventilate their grievances&mdash;it was certainly fortunate for the
popularity of her people in the Far East that Great Britain saw
her way finally to set a liberal example. Nearly five years were
required to bring the other Occidental powers into line with Great
Britain and America. It should be stated, however, that neither
reluctance to make the necessary concessions nor want of sympathy
with Japan caused the delay. The explanation is, first,
that each set of negotiators sought to improve either the terms
or the terminology of the treaties already concluded, and,
secondly, that the tariff arrangements for the different countries
required elaborate discussion.</p>

<p>Until the last of the revised treaties was ratified, voices of
protest against revision continued to be vehemently raised by a
large section of the foreign community in the settlements.
Some were honestly apprehensive as to the
<span class="sidenote">Reception given to the Revised Treaties.</span>
issue of the experiment. Others were swayed by
racial prejudice. A few had fallen into an insuperable
habit of grumbling, or found their account in advocating
conservatism under pretence of championing foreign interests;
and all were naturally reluctant to forfeit the immunity from
taxation hitherto enjoyed. It seemed as though the inauguration
of the new system would find the foreign community
in a mood which must greatly diminish the chances of a
happy result, for where a captious and aggrieved disposition
exists, opportunities to discover causes of complaint cannot
be wanting. But at the eleventh hour this unfavourable
demeanour underwent a marked change. So soon as it became
evident that the old system was hopelessly doomed, the sound
common sense of the European and American business man
asserted itself. The foreign residents let it be seen that they
intended to bow cheerfully to the inevitable, and that no obstacles
would be willingly placed by them in the path of Japanese jurisdiction.
The Japanese, on their side, took some promising steps.
An Imperial rescript declared in unequivocal terms that it was
the sovereign&rsquo;s policy and desire to abolish all distinctions
between natives and foreigners, and that by fully carrying out
the friendly purpose of the treaties his people would best consult
his wishes, maintain the character of the nation, and promote
its prestige. The premier and other ministers of state issued
instructions to the effect that the responsibility now devolved
on the government, and the duty on the people, of enabling
foreigners to reside confidently and contentedly in every part of
the country. Even the chief Buddhist prelates addressed to the
priests and parishioners in their dioceses injunctions pointing
out that, freedom of conscience being now guaranteed by the
constitution, men professing alien creeds must be treated as
courteously as the followers of Buddhism, and must enjoy the
same rights and privileges.</p>

<p>Thus the great change was effected in circumstances of happy
augury. Its results were successful on the whole. Foreigners
residing in Japan now enjoy immunity of domicile, personal
and religious liberty, freedom from official interference, and
security of life and property as fully as though they were living
in their own countries, and they have gradually learned to look
with greatly increased respect upon Japanese law and its
administrators.</p>

<p>Next to the revision of the treaties and to the result of the
great wars waged by Japan since the resumption of foreign intercourse,
the most memorable incident in her modern
career was the conclusion, first, of an <i>entente</i>, and,
<span class="sidenote">Anglo-Japanese Alliance.</span>
secondly, of an offensive and defensive alliance
with Great Britain in January 1902 and September 1905,
respectively. The <i>entente</i> set out by disavowing on the part of
each of the contracting parties any aggressive tendency in either
China or Korea, the independence of which two countries was
explicitly recognized; and went on to declare that Great Britain
in China and Japan in China and Korea might take indispensable
means to safeguard their interests; while, if such measures
involved one of the signatories in war with a third power, the
other signatory would not only remain neutral but would also
endeavour to prevent other powers from joining in hostilities
against its ally, and would come to the assistance of the latter in
the event of its being faced by two or more powers. The <i>entente</i>
further recognized that Japan possessed, in a peculiar degree,
political, commercial and industrial interests in Korea. This
agreement, equally novel for each of the contracting parties,
evidently tended to the benefit of Japan more than to that of
Great Britain, inasmuch as the interests in question were vital
from the former power&rsquo;s point of view but merely local from the
latter&rsquo;s. The inequality was corrected by an offensive and
defensive alliance in 1905. For the scope of the agreement was
then extended to India and eastern Asia generally, and while the
signatories pledged themselves, on the one hand, to preserve the
common interests of all powers in China by insuring her integrity
and independence as well as the principle of equal opportunities
for the commerce and industry of all nations within her borders,
they agreed, on the other, to maintain their own territorial rights
in eastern Asia and India, and to come to each other&rsquo;s armed
assistance in the event of those rights being assailed by any other
power or powers. These agreements have, of course, a close
relation to the events which accompanied or immediately
preceded them, but they also present a vivid and radical contrast
between a country which, less than half a century previously,
had struggled vehemently to remain secluded from the
world, and a country which now allied itself with one of the
most liberal and progressive nations for the purposes of a policy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
extending over the whole of eastern Asia and India. This
contrast was accentuated two years later (1907) when France
and Russia concluded <i>ententes</i> with Japan, recognizing the independence
and integrity of the Chinese Empire, as well as the
principle of equal opportunity for all nations in that country,
and engaging to support each other for assuring peace and
security there. Japan thus became a world power in the most
unequivocal sense.</p>

<p><i>Japan&rsquo;s Foreign Wars and Complications</i>.&mdash;The earliest foreign
war conducted by Japan is said to have taken place at the
beginning of the 3rd century, when the empress Jing&#333;
led an army to the conquest of Korea. But as the
<span class="sidenote">War with Korea.</span>
event is supposed to have happened more than 500
years before the first Japanese record was written, its traditional
details cannot be seriously discussed. There is, however, no
room to doubt that from time to time in early ages Japanese
troops were seen in Korea, though they made no permanent
impression on the country. It was reserved for Hideyoshi, the
taik&#333;, to make the Korean peninsula the scene of a great
over-sea campaign. Hideyoshi, the Napoleon of Japan, having
brought the whole empire under his sway as the sequel of many
years of incomparable generalship and statecraft, conceived the
project of subjugating China. By some historians his motive has
been described as a desire to find employment for the immense
mob of armed men whom four centuries of almost continuous
fighting had called into existence in Japan: he felt that domestic
peace could not be permanently restored unless these restless
spirits were occupied abroad. But although that object may
have reinforced his purpose, his ambition aimed at nothing less
than the conquest of China, and he regarded Korea merely as a
stepping-stone to that aim. Had Korea consented to be put to
such a use, she need not have fought or suffered. The Koreans,
however, counted China invincible. They considered that Japan
would be shattered by the first contact with the great empire,
and therefore although, in the 13th century, they had given the
use of their harbours to the Mongol invaders of Japan, they flatly
refused in the 16th to allow their territory to be used for a
Japanese invasion of China. On the 24th of May 1592 the wave
of invasion rolled against Korea&rsquo;s southern coast. Hideyoshi
had chosen Nagoya in the province of Hizen as the home-base
of his operations. There the sea separating Japan from the
Korean peninsula narrows to a strait divided into two channels
of almost equal width by the island of Tsushima. To reach this
island from the Japanese side was an easy and safe task, but in
the 56-mile channel that separated Tsushima from the peninsula
an invading flotilla had to run the risk of attack by Korean war-ships.
At Nagoya Hideyoshi assembled an army of over 300,000
men, of whom some 70,000 constituted the first fighting line,
87,000 the second, and the remainder formed a reserve to be
subsequently drawn on as occasion demanded. The question
of transport presented some difficulty, but it was solved by the
simple expedient of ordering every feudatory to furnish two ships
for each 100,000 <i>koku</i> of his fief&rsquo;s revenue. These were not
fighting vessels but mere transports. As for the plan of campaign,
it was precisely in accord with modern principles of
strategy, and bore witness to the daring genius of Hideyoshi. The
van, consisting of three army corps and mustering in all 51,000
men, was to cross rapidly to Fusan, on the south coast of the
peninsula, and immediately commence a movement northward
towards the capital, Seoul, one corps moving by the eastern
coast-road, one by the central route, and one by the western coast-line.
Thereafter the other four corps, which formed the first
fighting line, together with the corps under the direct orders of
the commander-in-chief, Ukida Hideiye, were to cross, for the
purpose of effectually subduing the regions through which the
van had passed; and, finally, the two remaining corps of the
second line were to be transported by sea up the west coast of
the peninsula, to form a junction with the van which, by that
time, should be preparing to pass into China over the northern
boundary of Korea, namely, the Yalu River. For the landing
place of these reinforcements the town of Phyong-yang was
adopted, being easily accessible by the Taidong River from the
coast. In later ages Japanese armies were destined to move
twice over these same regions, once to the invasion of China, once
to the attack of Russia, and they adopted almost the same
strategical plan as that mapped out by Hideyoshi in the year
1592. The forecast was that the Koreans would offer their chief
resistance, first, at the capital, Seoul; next at Phyong-yang,
and finally at the Yalu, as the approaches to all these places
offered positions capable of being utilized to great advantage for
defensive purposes.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May 1592 the first army corps, under the
command of Konishi Yukinaga, crossed unmolested to the
peninsula; next day the castle of Fusan was carried
by storm, which same fate befell, on the 27th,
<span class="sidenote">Landing In Korea and Advance of the Invaders.</span>
another and stronger fortress lying 3 miles inland
and garrisoned by 20,000 picked soldiers. The
invaders were irresistible. From the landing-place
at Fusan to the gates of Seoul the distance is 267 miles.
Konishi&rsquo;s corps covered that interval in 19 days, storming two
forts, carrying two positions and fighting one pitched battle <i>en
route</i>. On the 12th of June the Korean capital was in Japanese
hands, and by the 16th four army corps had assembled there,
while four others had effected a landing at Fusan. After a rest
of 15 days the northward advance was resumed, and July 15th
saw Phyong-yang in Japanese possession. The distance of 130
miles from Seoul to the Taidong had been traversed in 18 days,
10 having been occupied in forcing the passage of a river which,
if held with moderate resolution and skill, should have stopped
the Japanese altogether. At this point, however, the invasion
suffered a check owing to a cause which in modern times has
received much attention, though in Hideyoshi&rsquo;s days it had been
little considered; the Japanese lost the command of the sea.</p>

<p>The Japanese idea of sea-fighting in those times was to use
open boats propelled chiefly by oars. They closed as quickly as
possible with the enemy, and then fell on with the
trenchant swords which they used so skilfully.
<span class="sidenote">Fighting at Sea.</span>
Now during the 15th century and part of the 16th
the Chinese had been so harassed by Japanese piratical raids that
their inventive genius, quickened by suffering, suggested a
device for coping with these formidable adversaries. Once
allow the Japanese swordsman to come to close quarters and he
carried all before him. To keep him at a distance, then, was the
great desideratum, and the Chinese compassed this in maritime
warfare by completely covering their boats with roofs of solid
timber, so that those within were protected against missiles,
while loop-holes and ports enabled them to pour bullets and
arrows on a foe. The Koreans learned this device from the
Chinese and were the first to employ it in actual warfare. Their
own history alleges that they improved upon the Chinese model
by nailing sheet iron over the roofs and sides of the &ldquo;turtle-shell&rdquo;
craft and studding the whole surface with <i>chevaux de frise</i>, but
Japanese annals indicate that in the great majority of cases solid
timber alone was used. It seems strange that the Japanese
should have been without any clear perception of the immense
fighting superiority possessed by such protected war-vessels over
small open boats. But certainly they were either ignorant or
indifferent. The fleet which they provided to hold the command
of Korean waters did not include one vessel of any magnitude;
it consisted simply of some hundreds of row-boats manned by
7000 men. Hideyoshi himself was perhaps not without misgivings.
Six years previously he had endeavoured to obtain two
war-galleons from the Portuguese, and had he succeeded, the
history of the Far East might have been radically different.
Evidently, however, he committed a blunder which his countrymen
in modern times have conspicuously avoided; he drew the
sword without having fully investigated his adversary&rsquo;s resources.
Just about the time when the van of the Japanese army was
entering Seoul, the Korean admiral, Yi Sun-sin, at the head of a
fleet of 80 vessels, attacked the Japanese squadron which lay at
anchor near the entrance to Fusan harbour, set 26 of the vessels
on fire and dispersed the rest. Four other engagements ensued
in rapid succession. The last and most important took place
shortly after the Japanese troops had seized Phyong-yang. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
resulted in the sinking of over 70 Japanese vessels, transports
and fighting ships combined, which formed the main part of a
flotilla carrying reinforcements by sea to the van of the invading
army. This despatch of troops and supplies by water had been
a leading feature of Hideyoshi&rsquo;s plan of campaign, and the
destruction of the flotilla to which the duty was entrusted may
be said to have sealed the fate of the war by isolating the army
in Korea from its home base. It is true that Konishi Yukinaga,
who commanded the first division, would have continued his
northward march from Phyong-yang without delay. He argued
that China was wholly unprepared, and that the best hope of
ultimate victory lay in not giving her time to collect her forces.
But the commander-in-chief, Ukida Hideiye, refused to endorse
this plan. He took the view that since the Korean provinces
were still offering desperate resistance, supplies could not be
drawn from them, neither could the troops engaged in subjugating
them be freed for service at the front. Therefore it was
essential to await the consummation of the second phase of
Hideyoshi&rsquo;s plan, namely, the despatch of reinforcements and
munitions by water to Phyong-yang. The reader has seen how
that second phase fared. The Japanese commander at Phyong-yang
never received any accession of strength. His force
suffered constant diminution from casualties, and the question
of commissariat became daily more difficult. It is further plain
to any reader of history&mdash;and Japanese historians themselves
admit the fact&mdash;that no wise effort was made to conciliate the
Korean people. They were treated so harshly that even the
humble peasant took up arms, and thus the peninsula, instead
of serving as a basis of supplies, had to be garrisoned perpetually
by a strong army.</p>

<p>The Koreans, having suffered for their loyalty to China,
naturally looked to her for succour. Again and again appeals
were made to Peking, and at length a force of 5000
men, which had been mobilized in the Liaotung
<span class="sidenote">Chinese Intervention.</span>
peninsula, crossed the Yalu and moved south to
Phyong-yang, where the Japanese van had been lying idle for
over two months. This was early in October 1592. Memorable
as the first encounter between Japanese and Chinese, the incident
also illustrated China&rsquo;s supreme confidence in her own ineffable
superiority. The whole of the Korean forces had been driven
northward throughout the entire length of the peninsula by the
Japanese armies, yet Peking considered that 5000 Chinese
&ldquo;braves&rdquo; would suffice to roll back this tide of invasion. Three
thousand of the Chinese were killed and the remainder fled
pell-mell across the Yalu. China now began to be seriously
alarmed. She collected an army variously estimated at from
51,000 to 200,000 men, and marching it across Manchuria in the
dead of winter, hurled it against Phyong-yang during the first
week of February 1593. The Japanese garrison did not exceed
20,000, nearly one-half of its original number having been detached
to hold a line of forts which guarded the communications
with Seoul. Moreover, the Chinese, though their swords were
much inferior to the Japanese weapon, possessed great superiority
in artillery and cavalry, as well as in the fact that their troopers
wore iron mail which defied the keenest blade. Thus, after a
severe fight, the Japanese had to evacuate Phyong-yang and fall
back upon Seoul. But this one victory alone stands to China&rsquo;s
credit. In all subsequent encounters of any magnitude her army
suffered heavy defeats, losing on one occasion some 10,000 men,
on another 4000, and on a third 39,000. But the presence of her
forces and the determined resistance offered by the Koreans effectually
saved China from invasion. Indeed, after the evacuation
of Seoul, on the 9th of May 1593, Hideyoshi abandoned all idea of
carrying the war into Chinese territory, and devoted his attention
to obtaining honourable terms of peace, the Japanese troops
meanwhile holding a line of forts along the southern coast of
Korea. He died before that end had been accomplished.
Had he lived a few days longer, he would have learned
of a crushing defeat inflicted on the Chinese forces (at Sö-chhön,
October 30, 1598), when the Satsuma men under Shimazu
Yoshihiro took 38,700 Chinese heads and sent the noses and ears
to Japan, where they now lie buried under a tumulus (<i>mimizuka</i>,
ear-mound) near the temple of Daibutsu in Ki&#333;to. Thereafter
the statesmen to whom the regent on his death-bed had entrusted
the duty of terminating the struggle and recalling the troops,
intimated to the enemy that the evacuation of the peninsula
might be obtained if a Korean prince repaired to Japan as envoy,
and if some tiger-skins and <i>ginseng</i> were sent to Ki&#333;to in token
of amity. So ended one of the greatest over-sea campaigns
recorded in history. It had lasted 6½ years, had seen 200,000
Japanese troops at one time on Korean soil, and had cost something
like a quarter of a million lives.</p>

<p>From the recall of the Korea expedition in 1598 to the resumption
of intercourse with the Occident in modern times, Japan
enjoyed uninterrupted peace with foreign nations.
<span class="sidenote">Contrast between Foreign Relations in Medieval and Modern Times.</span>
Thereafter she had to engage in four wars. It is a
striking contrast. During the first eleven centuries
of her historical existence she was involved in only
one contest abroad; during the next half century she
fought four times beyond the sea and was confronted
by many complications. Whatever material or moral
advantages her association with the West conferred on her, it
did not bring peace.</p>

<p>The first menacing foreign complication with which the
Japanese government of the Meiji era had to deal was connected
with the traffic in Chinese labour, an abuse not yet
wholly eradicated. In 1872, a Peruvian ship, the
<span class="sidenote">The &ldquo;Maria Luz&rdquo; Complication.</span>
&ldquo;Maria Luz,&rdquo; put into port at Yokohama, carrying
200 contract labourers. One of the unfortunate men succeeded
in reaching the shore and made a piteous appeal to the Japanese
authorities, who at once seized the vessel and released her freight
of slaves, for they were little better. The Japanese had not
always been so particular. In the days of early foreign intercourse,
before England&rsquo;s attitude towards slavery had established
a new code of ethics, Portuguese ships had been permitted to
carry away from Hirado, as they did from Macao, cargoes of men
and women, doomed to a life of enforced toil if they survived the
horrors of the voyage. But modern Japan followed the tenets
of modern morality in such matters. Of course the Peruvian
government protested, and for a time relations were strained
almost to the point of rupture; but it was finally agreed that the
question should be submitted to the arbitration of the tsar, who
decided in Japan&rsquo;s favour. Japan&rsquo;s attitude in this affair
elicited applause, not merely from the point of view of humanity,
but also because of the confidence she showed in Occidental
justice.</p>

<p>Another complication which occupied the attention of the
T&#333;ky&#333; government from the beginning of the Meiji era was in
truth a legacy from the days of feudalism. In
those days the island of Yezo, as well as Sakhalin
<span class="sidenote">The Sakhalin Complication.</span>
on its north-west and the Kurile group on its north,
could scarcely be said to be in effective Japanese
occupation. It is true that the feudal chief of Matsumae (now
Fuku-yama), the remains of whose castle may still be seen on the
coast at the southern extremity of the island of Yezo, exercised
nominal jurisdiction; but his functions did not greatly exceed
the levying of taxes on the aboriginal inhabitants of Yezo, the
Kuriles and southern Sakhalin. Thus from the beginning of the
18th century Russian fishermen began to settle in the Kuriles
and Russian ships menaced Sakhalin. There can be no doubt
that the first explorers of Sakhalin were Japanese. As early as
1620, some vassals of the feudal chief of Matsumae visited the
place and passed a winter there. It was then supposed to be a
peninsula forming part of the Asiatic mainland, but in 1806 a
daring Japanese traveller, by name Mamiya Rinzo, made his way
to Manchuria, voyaged up and down the Amur, and, crossing to
Sakhalin, discovered that a narrow strait separated it from the
mainland. There still prevails in the minds of many Occidentals
a belief that the discovery of Sakhalin&rsquo;s insular character was
reserved for Captain Nevelskoy, a Russian, who visited the place
in 1849, but in Japan the fact had then been known for 43 years.
Muravief, the great Russian empire-builder in East Asia, under
whose orders Nevelskoy acted, quickly appreciated the necessity
of acquiring Sakhalin, which commands the estuary of the Amur.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
After the conclusion of the treaty of Aigun (1857) he visited
Japan with a squadron, and required that the strait of La
Pérouse, which separates Sakhalin from Yezo, should be regarded
as the frontier between Russia and Japan. This would have
given the whole of Sakhalin to Russia. Japan refused, and
Muravief immediately resorted to the policy he had already
pursued with signal success in the Usuri region: he sent emigrants
to settle in Sakhalin. Twice the sh&#333;gunate attempted to
frustrate this process of gradual absorption by proposing a
division of the island along the 50th parallel of north latitude,
and finally, in 1872, the Meiji government offered to purchase the
Russian portion for 2,000,000 dollars (then equivalent to about
£400,000). St Petersburg, having by that time discovered the
comparative worthlessness of the island as a wealth-earning
possession, showed some signs of acquiescence, and possibly an
agreement might have been reached had not a leading Japanese
statesman&mdash;afterwards Count Kuroda&mdash;opposed the bargain as
disadvantageous to Japan. Finally St Petersburg&rsquo;s perseverance
won the day. In 1875 Japan agreed to recognize Russia&rsquo;s
title to the whole island on condition that Russia similarly
recognized Japan&rsquo;s title to the Kuriles. It was a singular compact.
Russia purchased a Japanese property and paid for it
with a part of Japan&rsquo;s belongings. These details form a curious
preface to the fact that Sakhalin was destined, 30 years later, to
be the scene of a Japanese invasion, in the sequel of which it was
divided along the 50th parallel as the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s administration
had originally proposed.</p>

<p>The first of Japan&rsquo;s four conflicts was an expedition to
Formosa in 1874. Insignificant from a military point of
view, this affair derives vicarious interest from its
effect upon the relations between China and Japan,
<span class="sidenote">Military Expedition to Formosa.</span>
and upon the question of the ownership of the
Ri&#363;ki&#363; islands. These islands, which lie at a little distance
south of Japan, had for centuries been regarded as an
apanage of the Satsuma fief. The language and customs of
their inhabitants showed unmistakable traces of relationship
to the Japanese, and the possibility of the islands being included
among the dominions of China had probably never occurred to
any Japanese statesman. When therefore, in 1873, the crew
of a wrecked Ri&#363;ki&#363;an junk were barbarously treated by the
inhabitants of northern Formosa, the Japanese government
unhesitatingly assumed the responsibility of seeking redress for
their outrage. Formosa being a part of the Chinese Empire,
complaint was duly preferred in Peking. But the Chinese
authorities showed such resolute indifference to Japan&rsquo;s representations
that the latter finally took the law into her own
hands, and sent a small force to punish the Formosan murderers,
who, of course, were found quite unable to offer any serious
resistance. The Chinese government, now recognizing the fact
that its territories had been invaded, lodged a protest which,
but for the intervention of the British minister in Peking,
might have involved the two empires in war. The final terms
of arrangement were that, in consideration of Japan withdrawing
her troops from Formosa, China should indemnify her to the
extent of the expenses of the expedition. In sending this
expedition to Formosa the government sought to placate the
Satsuma samurai, who were beginning to show much opposition
to certain features of the administrative reforms just inaugurated,
and who claimed special interest in the affairs of the
Ri&#363;ki&#363; islands.</p>

<p>Had Japan needed any confirmation of her belief that the
Ri&#363;ki&#363; islands belonged to her, the incidents and settlement of
the Formosan complication would have constituted
conclusive evidence. Thus in 1876 she did not
<span class="sidenote">The Ri&#363;ki&#363; Complication.</span>
hesitate to extend her newly organized system of
prefectural government to Ri&#363;ki&#363;, which thenceforth became
the Okinawa prefecture, the former ruler of the islands being
pensioned, according to the system followed in the case of
the feudal chiefs in Japan proper. China at once entered
an objection. She claimed that Ri&#363;ki&#363; had always been a
tributary of her empire, and she was doubtless perfectly sincere
in the contention. But China&rsquo;s interpretation of tribute did not
seem reducible to a working theory. So long as her own advantage
could be promoted, she regarded as a token of vassalage the
presents periodically carried to her court from neighbouring
states. So soon, however, as there arose any question of discharging
a suzerain&rsquo;s duties, she classed these offerings as insignificant
interchanges of neighbourly courtesy. It was true that
Ri&#363;ki&#363; had followed the custom of despatching gift-bearing
envoys to China from time to time, just as Japan herself had
done, though with less regularity. But it was also true that
Ri&#363;ki&#363; had been subdued by Satsuma without China stretching
out a hand to help her; that for two centuries the islands had
been included in the Satsuma fief, and that China, in the sequel
to the Formosan affair, had made a practical acknowledgment
of Japan&rsquo;s superior title to protect the islanders. Each empire
positively asserted its claims; but whereas Japan put hers into
practice, China confined herself to remonstrances. Things
remained in that state until 1880, when General Grant, visiting
the East, suggested the advisability of a compromise. A conference
met in Peking, and the plenipotentiaries agreed that the
islands should be divided, Japan taking the northern group,
China the southern. But on the eve of signature the Chinese
plenipotentiary drew back, pleading that he had no authority
to conclude an agreement without previously referring it to
certain other dignitaries. Japan, sensible that she had been
flouted, retired from the discussion and retained the islands,
China&rsquo;s share in them being reduced to a grievance.</p>

<p>From the 16th century, when the Korean peninsula was overrun
by Japanese troops, its rulers made a habit of sending a
present-bearing embassy to Japan to felicitate the
accession of each sh&#333;gun. But after the fall of
<span class="sidenote">The Korean Complication.</span>
the Tokugawa sh&#333;gunate, the Korean court desisted
from this custom, declared a determination to have no
further relations with a country embracing Western civilization,
and refused even to receive a Japanese embassy. This conduct
caused deep umbrage in Japan. Several prominent politicians
cast their votes for war, and undoubtedly the sword would have
been drawn had not the leading statesmen felt that a struggle
with Korea, involving probably a rupture with China, must
fatally check the progress of the administrative reforms then
(1873) in their infancy. Two years later, however, the Koreans
crowned their defiance by firing on the boats of a Japanese war-vessel
engaged in the operation of coast-surveying. No choice
now remained except to despatch an armed expedition against
the truculent kingdom. But Japan did not want to fight. In
this matter she showed herself an apt pupil of Occidental methods
such as had been practised against herself in former years. She
assembled an imposing force of war-ships and transports, but
instead of proceeding to extremities, she employed the squadron&mdash;which
was by no means so strong as it seemed&mdash;to intimidate
Korea into signing a treaty of amity and commerce, and opening
three ports to foreign trade (1876). That was the beginning of
Korea&rsquo;s friendly relations with the outer world, and Japan
naturally took credit for the fact that, thus early in her new
career, she had become an instrument for extending the principle
of universal intercourse opposed so strenuously by herself in the
past.</p>

<p>From time immemorial China&rsquo;s policy towards the petty states
on her frontiers had been to utilize them as buffers for softening
the shock of foreign contact, while contriving, at
the same time, that her relations with them should
<span class="sidenote">War with China.</span>
involve no inconvenient responsibilities for herself.
The aggressive impulses of the outside world were to be checked
by an unproclaimed understanding that the territories of these
states partook of the inviolability of China, while the states, on
their side, must never expect their suzerain to bear the consequences
of their acts. This arrangement, depending largely on
sentiment and prestige, retained its validity in the atmosphere
of Oriental seclusion, but quickly failed to endure the test of
modern Occidental practicality. Tongking, Annam, Siam and
Burma were withdrawn, one by one, from the fiction of dependence
on China and independence towards all other countries.
But with regard to Korea, China proved more tenacious. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
possession of the peninsula by a foreign power would have
threatened the maritime route to the Chinese capital and given
easy access to Manchuria, the cradle of the dynasty which ruled
China. Therefore Peking statesmen endeavoured to preserve
the old-time relations with the little kingdom. But they could
never persuade themselves to modify the indirect methods
sanctioned by tradition. Instead of boldly declaring Korea a
dependency of China, they sought to keep up the romance of
ultimate dependency and intermediate sovereignty. Thus in
1876 Korea was suffered to conclude with Japan a treaty of
which the first article declared her &ldquo;an independent state
enjoying the same rights as Japan,&rdquo; and subsequently to make
with the United States (1882), Great Britain (1883) and other
powers, treaties in which her independence was constructively
admitted. China, however, did not intend that Korea should
exercise the independence thus conventionally recognized. A
Chinese resident was placed in Seoul, and a system of steady
though covert interference in Korea&rsquo;s affairs was inaugurated.
The chief sufferer from these anomalous conditions was Japan.
In all her dealings with Korea, in all complications that arose
out of her comparatively large trade with the peninsula, in all
questions connected with her numerous settlers there, she found
herself negotiating with a dependency of China, and with
officials who took their orders from the Chinese representative.
China had long entertained a rooted apprehension of Japanese
aggression in Korea&mdash;an apprehension not unwarranted by
history&mdash;and that distrust tinged all the influence exerted by her
agents there. On many occasions Japan was made sensible of
the discrimination thus exercised against her. Little by little
the consciousness roused her indignation, and although no
single instance constituted a ground for strong international
protest, the Japanese people gradually acquired a sense of being
perpetually baffled, thwarted and humiliated by China&rsquo;s interference
in Korean affairs. For thirty years China had treated
Japan as a contemptible deserter from the Oriental standard,
and had regarded her progressive efforts with openly disdainful
aversion; while Japan, on her side, had chafed more and more
to furnish some striking evidence of the wisdom of her preference
for Western civilization. Even more serious were the consequences
of Chinese interference from the point of view of Korean
administration. The rulers of the country lost all sense of
national responsibility, and gave unrestrained sway to selfish
ambition. The functions of the judiciary and of the executive
alike came to be discharged by bribery only. Family interests
predominated over those of the state. Taxes were imposed in
proportion to the greed of local officials. No thought whatever
was taken for the welfare of the people or for the development
of the country&rsquo;s resources. Personal responsibility was unknown
among officials. To be a member of the Min family, to which
the queen belonged, was to possess a passport to office and an
indemnity against the consequences of abuse of power. From
time to time the advocates of progress or the victims of oppression
rose in arms. They effected nothing except to recall to the
world&rsquo;s recollection the miserable condition into which Korea
had fallen. Chinese military aid was always furnished readily
for the suppression of these risings, and thus the Min family
learned to base its tenure of power on ability to conciliate China
and on readiness to obey Chinese dictation, while the people
at large fell into the apathetic condition of men who possess
neither security of property nor national ambition.</p>

<p>As a matter of state policy the Korean problem caused much
anxiety to Japan. Her own security being deeply concerned
in preserving Korea from the grasp of a Western power, she could
not suffer the little kingdom to drift into a condition of such
administrative incompetence and national debility that a strong
aggressor might find at any moment a pretext for interference.
On two occasions (1882 and 1884) when China&rsquo;s armed intervention
was employed in the interests of the Min to suppress movements
of reform, the partisans of the victors, regarding Japan
as the fountain of progressive tendencies, destroyed her legation
in Seoul and compelled its inmates to fly from the city. Japan
behaved with forbearance at these crises, but in the consequent
negotiations she acquired conventional titles that touched the
core of China&rsquo;s alleged suzerainty. In 1882 her right to maintain
troops in Seoul for the protection of her legation was
admitted; in 1885 she concluded with China a convention by
which each power pledged itself not to send troops to Korea
without notifying the other.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1894 a serious insurrection broke out in Korea,
and the Min family appealed for China&rsquo;s aid. On the 6th of
July 2500 Chinese troops embarked at Tientsin and
were transported to the peninsula, where they went
<span class="sidenote">The Rupture with China.</span>
into camp at Ya-shan (Asan), on the south-west
coast, notice of the measure being given by the Chinese government
to the Japanese representative at Peking, according to
treaty. During the interval immediately preceding these events,
Japan had been rendered acutely sensible of China&rsquo;s arbitrary
and unfriendly interference in Korea. Twice the efforts of the
Japanese government to obtain redress for unlawful and ruinous
commercial prohibitions had been thwarted by the Chinese
representative in Seoul; and an ultimatum addressed from T&#333;ky&#333;
to the Korean government had elicited from the viceroy Li
in Tientsin a thinly veiled threat of Chinese armed opposition.
Still more provocative of national indignation was China&rsquo;s
procedure with regard to the murder of Kim Ok-kyun, the leader
of progress in Korea, who had been for some years a refugee in
Japan. Inveigled from Japan to China by a fellow-countryman
sent from Seoul to assassinate him, Kim was shot in a Japanese
hotel in Shanghai; and China, instead of punishing the murderer,
conveyed him in a war-ship of her own to Korea to be publicly
honoured. When, therefore, the Korean insurrection of 1894
induced the Min family again to solicit China&rsquo;s armed intervention,
the T&#333;ky&#333; government concluded that, in the interests of
Japan&rsquo;s security and of civilization in the Orient, steps must be
taken to put an end to the misrule which offered incessant invitations
to foreign aggression, and checked Korea&rsquo;s capacity to
maintain its own independence. Japan did not claim for herself
any rights or interests in the peninsula superior to those possessed
there by China. But there was not the remotest probability
that China, whose face had been contemptuously set against all
the progressive measures adopted by Japan during the preceding
twenty-five years, would join in forcing upon a neighbouring
kingdom the very reforms she herself despised, were her co-operation
invited through ordinary diplomatic channels only.
It was necessary to contrive a situation which would not only
furnish clear proof of Japan&rsquo;s resolution, but also enable her to
pursue her programme independently of Chinese endorsement,
should the latter be finally unobtainable. She therefore met
China&rsquo;s notice of a despatch of troops with a corresponding
notice of her own, and the month of July 1894 found a Chinese
force assembled at Asan and a Japanese force occupying positions
in the neighbourhood of Seoul. China&rsquo;s motive for sending
troops was nominally to quell the Tonghak insurrection, but
really to re-affirm her own domination in the peninsula. Japan&rsquo;s
motive was to secure such a position as would enable her to
insist upon the radically curative treatment of Korea&rsquo;s malady.
Up to this point the two empires were strictly within their conventional
rights. Each was entitled by treaty to send troops
to Korea, provided that notice was given to the other. But
China, in giving notice, described Korea as her &ldquo;tributary state,&rdquo;
thus thrusting into the forefront of the discussion a contention
which Japan, from conciliatory motives, would have kept out of
sight. Once formally advanced, however, the claim had to be
challenged. In the treaty of amity and commerce concluded in
1876 between Japan and Korea, the two high contracting parties
were explicitly declared to possess the same national status.
Japan could not agree that a power which for nearly two decades
she had acknowledged and treated as her equal should be openly
classed as a tributary of China. She protested, but the Chinese
statesmen took no notice of her protest. They continued to
apply the disputed appellation to Korea, and they further
asserted their assumption of sovereignty in the peninsula by seeking
to set limits to the number of troops sent by Japan, as well as
to the sphere of their employment. Japan then proposed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
the two empires should unite their efforts for the suppression of
disturbances in Korea, and for the subsequent improvement of
that kingdom&rsquo;s administration, the latter purpose to be pursued
by the despatch of a joint commission of investigation. But
China refused everything. Ready at all times to interfere by
force of arms between the Korean people and the dominant
political faction, she declined to interfere in any way for the
promotion of reform. She even expressed supercilious surprise
that Japan, while asserting Korea&rsquo;s independence, should suggest
the idea of peremptorily reforming its administration. In short,
for Chinese purposes the Peking statesmen openly declared
Korea a tributary state; but for Japanese purposes they insisted
that it must be held independent. They believed that their
island neighbour aimed at the absorption of Korea into the
Japanese empire. Viewed in the light of that suspicion,
China&rsquo;s attitude became comprehensible, but her procedure was
inconsistent, illogical and unpractical. The T&#333;ky&#333; cabinet now
declared its resolve not to withdraw the Japanese troops without
&ldquo;some understanding that would guarantee the future peace,
order, and good government of Korea,&rdquo; and since China still
declined to come to such an understanding, Japan undertook
the work of reform single-handed.</p>

<p>The Chinese representative in Seoul threw his whole weight
into the scale against the success of these reforms. But the determining
cause of rupture was in itself a belligerent
operation. China&rsquo;s troops had been sent originally for
<span class="sidenote">Outbreak of Hostilities.</span>
the purpose of quelling the Tonghak rebellion. But
the rebellion having died of inanition before the landing of the
troops, their services were not required. Nevertheless China
kept them in Korea, her declared reason for doing so being the
presence of a Japanese military force. Throughout the subsequent
negotiations the Chinese forces lay in an entrenched camp
at Asan, while the Japanese occupied Seoul. An attempt on
China&rsquo;s part to send reinforcements could be construed only as an
unequivocal declaration of resolve to oppose Japan&rsquo;s proceedings
by force of arms. Nevertheless China not only despatched
troops by sea to strengthen the camp at Asan, but also sent an
army overland across Korea&rsquo;s northern frontier. At this stage
an act of war occurred. Three Chinese men-of-war, convoying
a transport with 1200 men encountered and fired on three
Japanese cruisers. One of the Chinese ships was taken;
another was so shattered that she had to be beached and
abandoned; the third escaped in a dilapidated condition; and
the transport, refusing to surrender, was sunk. This happened
on the 25th of July 1894, and an open declaration of war was
made by each empire six days later.</p>

<p>From the moment when Japan applied herself to break away
from Oriental traditions, and to remove from her limbs the
fetters of Eastern conservatism, it was inevitable
that a widening gulf should gradually grow between
<span class="sidenote">Remote Origin of the Conflict.</span>
herself and China. The war of 1894 was really
a contest between Japanese progress and Chinese
stagnation. To secure Korean immunity from foreign&mdash;especially
Russian&mdash;aggression was of capital importance to both
empires. Japan believed that such security could be attained
by introducing into Korea the civilization which had contributed
so signally to the development of her own strength
and resources. China thought that she could guarantee it
without any departure from old-fashioned methods, and by the
same process of capricious protection which had failed so signally
in the cases of Annam, Tongking, Burma and Siam. The issue
really at stake was whether Japan should be suffered to act as
the Eastern propagandist of Western progress, or whether her
efforts in that cause should be held in check by Chinese
conservatism.</p>

<p>The war itself was a succession of triumphs for Japan. Four
days after the first naval encounter she sent from Seoul a column
of troops who routed the Chinese entrenched at
Asan. Many of the fugitives effected their escape to
<span class="sidenote">Events of the War.</span>
Phyong-yang, a town on the Taidong River, offering
excellent facilities for defence, and historically interesting as the
place where a Japanese army of invasion had its first encounter
with Chinese troops in 1592. There the Chinese assembled a force
of 17,000 men, and made leisurely preparations for a decisive
contest. Forty days elapsed before the Japanese columns converged
upon Phyong-yang, and that interval was utilized by the
Chinese to throw up parapets, mount Krupp guns and otherwise
strengthen their position. Moreover, they were armed with
repeating rifles, whereas the Japanese had only single-loaders,
and the ground offered little cover for an attacking force. In
such circumstances, the advantages possessed by the defence
ought to have been well-nigh insuperable; yet a day&rsquo;s fighting
sufficed to carry all the positions, the assailants&rsquo; casualties
amounting to less than 700 and the defenders losing 6000 in
killed and wounded. This brilliant victory was the prelude to
an equally conspicuous success at sea. For on the 17th of
September, the very day after the battle at Phyong-yang, a great
naval fight took place near the mouth of the Yalu River, which
forms the northern boundary of Korea. Fourteen Chinese war-ships
and six torpedo-boats were returning to home ports after
convoying a fleet of transports to the Yalu, when they
encountered eleven Japanese men-of-war cruising in the
Yellow Sea. Hitherto the Chinese had sedulously avoided a
contest at sea. Their fleet included two armoured battleships
of over 7000 tons displacement, whereas the biggest vessels
on the Japanese side were belted cruisers of only 4000
tons. In the hands of an admiral appreciating the value of
sea power, China&rsquo;s naval force would certainly have been
led against Japan&rsquo;s maritime communications, for a successful
blow struck there must have put an end to the Korean
campaign. The Chinese, however, failed to read history.
They employed their war-vessels as convoys only, and, when not
using them for that purpose, hid them in port. Everything goes
to show that they would have avoided the battle off the Yalu
had choice been possible, though when forced to fight they fought
bravely. Four of their ships were sunk, and the remainder
escaped to Wei-hai-wei, the vigour of the Japanese pursuit
being greatly impaired by the presence of torpedo-boats in the
retreating squadron.</p>

<p>The Yalu victory opened the over-sea route to China. Japan
could now strike at Talien, Port Arthur, and Wei-hai-wei, naval
stations on the Liaotung and Shantung peninsulas, where powerful
permanent fortifications, built after plans prepared by
European experts and armed with the best modern weapons, were
regarded as almost impregnable; They fell before the assaults
of the Japanese troops as easily as the comparatively rude fortifications
at Phyong-yang had fallen. The only resistance of
a stubborn character was made by the Chinese fleet at Wei-hai-wei;
but after the whole squadron of torpedo-craft had been
destroyed or captured as they attempted to escape, and after
three of the largest vessels had been sunk at their moorings by
Japanese torpedoes, and one by gun-fire, the remaining ships
surrendered, and their brave commander, Admiral Ting, committed
suicide. This ended the war. It had lasted seven and a
half months, during which time Japan put into the field five
columns, aggregating about 120,000 of all arms. One of these
columns marched northward from Seoul, won the battle of
Phyong-yang, advanced to the Yalu, forced its way into Manchuria,
and moved towards Mukden by Feng-hwang, fighting
several minor engagements, and conducting the greater part of
its operations amid deep snow in midwinter. The second
column diverged westwards from the Yalu, and, marching
through southern Manchuria, reached Hai-cheng, whence it
advanced to the capture of Niuchwang and Ying-tse-kow. The
third landed on the Liaotung peninsula, and, turning southwards,
carried Talien and Port Arthur by assault. The fourth moved
up the Liaotung peninsula, and, having seized Kaiping, advanced
against Ying-tse-kow, where it joined hands with the second
column. The fifth crossed from Port Arthur to Wei-hai-wei,
and captured the latter. In all these operations the total
Japanese casualties were 1005 killed and 4922 wounded&mdash;figures
which sufficiently indicate the inefficiency of the Chinese
fighting. The deaths from disease totalled 16,866, and the
total monetary expenditure was £20,000,000 sterling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span></p>

<p>The Chinese government sent Li Hung-chang, viceroy of
Pechili and senior grand secretary of state, and Li Ching-fong, to
discuss terms of peace with Japan, the latter being
represented by Marquis (afterwards Prince) It&#333; and
<span class="sidenote">Conclusion of Peace.</span>
Count Mutsu, prime minister and minister for foreign
affairs, respectively. A treaty was signed at Shimonoseki on
the 17th of April 1895, and subsequently ratified by the sovereigns
of the two empires. It declared the absolute independence
of Korea; ceded to Japan the part of Manchuria lying south of
a line drawn from the mouth of the river Anping to the mouth
of the Liao, through Feng-hwang, Hai-cheng and Ying-tse-kow,
as well as the islands of Formosa and the Pescadores; pledged
China to pay an indemnity of 200,000,000 taels; provided for
the occupation of Wei-hai-wei by Japan pending payment of
the indemnity; secured some additional commercial privileges,
such as the opening of four new places to foreign trade and the
right of foreigners to engage in manufacturing enterprises in
China, and provided for the conclusion of a treaty of commerce
and amity between the two empires, based on the lines of China&rsquo;s
treaties with Occidental powers.</p>

<p>No sooner was this agreement ratified than Russia, Germany
and France presented a joint note to the T&#333;ky&#333; government,
recommending that the territories ceded to Japan on
the mainland of China should not be permanently
<span class="sidenote">Foreign Interference.</span>
occupied, as such a proceeding would be detrimental
to peace. The recommendation was couched in the usual terms of
diplomatic courtesy, but everything indicated that its signatories
were prepared to enforce their advice by an appeal to arms.
Japan found herself compelled to comply. Exhausted by the
Chinese campaign, which had drained her treasury, consumed
her supplies of warlike material, and kept her squadrons constantly
at sea for eight months, she had no residue of strength
to oppose such a coalition. Her resolve was quickly taken.
The day that saw the publication of the ratified treaty saw also
the issue of an Imperial rescript in which the mikado, avowing
his unalterable devotion to the cause of peace, and recognizing
that the counsel offered by the European states was prompted
by the same sentiment, &ldquo;yielded to the dictates of magnanimity,
and accepted the advice of the three Powers.&rdquo; The Japanese
people were shocked by this incident. They could understand
the motives influencing Russia and France, for it was evidently
natural that the former should desire to exclude warlike and
progressive people like the Japanese from territories contiguous
to her borders, and it was also natural that France should remain
true to her alliance with Russia. But Germany, wholly uninterested
in the ownership of Manchuria, and by profession a
warm friend of Japan, seemed to have joined in robbing the
latter of the fruits of her victory simply for the sake of establishing
some shadowy title to Russia&rsquo;s goodwill. It was not
known until a later period that the German emperor entertained
profound apprehensions about the &ldquo;yellow peril,&rdquo; an
irruption of Oriental hordes into the Occident, and held it a
sacred duty to prevent Japan from gaining a position which
might enable her to construct an immense military machine
out of the countless millions of China.</p>

<p>Japan&rsquo;s third expedition over-sea in the Meiji era had its
origin in causes which belong to the history of China (<i>q.v.</i>).
In the second half of 1900 an anti-foreign and anti-dynastic
rebellion, breaking out in Shantung, spread
<span class="sidenote">Chinese Crisis of 1900.</span>
to the metropolitan province of Pechili, and resulted
in a situation of extreme peril for the foreign communities of
Tientsin and Peking. It was impossible for any European
power, or for the United States, to organize sufficiently prompt
measures of relief. Thus the eyes of the world turned to Japan,
whose proximity to the scene of disturbance rendered intervention
comparatively easy for her. But Japan hesitated. Knowing
now with what suspicion and distrust the development of her
resources and the growth of her military strength were regarded
by some European peoples, and aware that she had been
admitted to the comity of Western nations on sufferance, she
shrank, on the one hand, from seeming to grasp at an opportunity
for armed display, and, on the other, from the solecism of obtrusiveness
in the society of strangers. Not until Europe and America
made it quite plain that they needed and desired her aid did she
send a division (21,000) men to Pechili. Her troops played a
fine part in the subsequent expedition for the relief of Peking,
which had to be approached in midsummer under very trying
conditions. Fighting side by side with European and American
soldiers, and under the eyes of competent military critics, the
Japanese acquitted themselves in such a manner as to establish
a high military reputation. Further, after the relief of Peking
they withdrew a moiety of their forces, and that step, as well as
their unequivocal co-operation with Western powers in the subsequent
negotiations, helped to show the injustice of the
suspicions with which they had been regarded.</p>

<p>From the time (1895) when Russia, with the co-operation of
Germany and France, dictated to Japan a cardinal alteration
of the Shimonoseki treaty, Japanese statesmen seem
to have concluded that their country must one day
<span class="sidenote">War with Russia.</span>
cross swords with the great northern power. Not a
few European and American publicists shared that view. But
the vast majority, arguing that the little Eastern empire would
never invite annihilation by such an encounter, believed that
sufficient forbearance to avert serious trouble would always be
forthcoming on Japan&rsquo;s side. Yet when the geographical and
historical situation was carefully considered, little hope of an
ultimately peaceful settlement presented itself.</p>

<p>Japan along its western shore, Korea along its southern and
eastern, and Russia along the eastern coast of its maritime
province, are washed by the Sea of Japan. The communications
between the sea and the Pacific Ocean are practically two
only. One is on the north-east, namely, Tsugaru Strait; the
other is on the south, namely, the channel between the extremity
of the Korean peninsula and the Japanese island of the nine
provinces. Tsugaru Strait is entirely under Japan&rsquo;s control.
It is between her main island and her island of Yezo, and in case
of need she can close it with mines. The channel between the
southern extremity of Korea and Japan has a width of 102 m.
and would therefore be a fine open sea-way were it free from
islands. But almost mid-way in this channel lie the twin
islands of Tsushima, and the space of 56 m. that separates them
from Japan is narrowed by another island, Iki. Tsushima and
Iki belong to the Japanese empire. The former has some exceptionally
good harbours, constituting a naval base from which
the channel on either side could easily be sealed. Thus the
avenues from the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan are controlled
by the Japanese empire. In other words, access to the
Pacific from Korea&rsquo;s eastern and southern coasts and access
to the Pacific from Russia&rsquo;s maritime province depend upon
Japan&rsquo;s goodwill. So far as Korea was concerned this question
mattered little, it being her fate to depend upon the goodwill
of Japan in affairs of much greater importance. But
with Russia the case was different. Vladivostok, which until
recent times was her principal port in the Far East, lies at the
southern extremity of the maritime province; that is to say, on
the north-western shore of the Japan Sea. It was therefore
necessary for Russia that freedom of passage by the Tsushima
channel should be secured, and to secure it one of two things
was essential, namely, either that she herself should possess a
fortified port on the Korean side, or that Japan should be bound
neither to acquire such a port nor to impose any restriction upon
the navigation of the strait. To put the matter briefly, Russia
must either acquire a strong foothold for herself in southern
Korea, or contrive that Japan should not acquire one. There
was here a strong inducement for Russian aggression in Korea.</p>

<p>Russia&rsquo;s eastward movement through Asia has been strikingly
illustrative of her strong craving for free access to southern seas
and of the impediments she had experienced in gratifying that
wish. An irresistible impulse had driven her oceanward.
Checked again and again in her attempts to reach the Mediterranean,
she set out on a five-thousand-miles march of conquest
right across the vast Asiatic continent towards the Pacific.
Eastward of Lake Baikal she found her line of least resistance
along the Amur, and when, owing to the restless perseverance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
of Muravief, she reached the mouth of that great river, the
acquisition of Nikolayevsk for a naval basis was her immediate
reward. But Nikolayevsk could not possibly satisfy her.
Situated in an inhospitable region far away from all the main
routes of the world&rsquo;s commerce, it offered itself only as a stepping-stone
to further acquisitions. To push southward from this
new port became an immediate object to Russia. There lay an
obstacle in the way, however; the long strip of sea-coast from the
mouth of the Amur to the Korean frontier&mdash;an area then called
the Usuri region because the Usuri forms its western boundary&mdash;belonged
to China, and she, having conceded much to Russia
in the matter of the Amur, showed no disposition to make further
concessions in the matter of the Usuri. In the presence of
menaces, however, she agreed that the region should be regarded
as common property pending a convenient opportunity for clear
delimitation. That opportunity came very soon. Seizing the
moment (1860) when China had been beaten to her knees by
England and France, Russia secured final cession of the Usuri
region, which now became the maritime province of Siberia.
Then Russia shifted her naval base on the Pacific from Nikolayevsk
to Vladivostok. She gained ten degrees in a southerly
direction.</p>

<p>From the mouth of the Amur, where Nikolayevsk is situated,
to the southern shore of Korea there rests on the coast of
eastern Asia an arch of islands having at its northern point
Sakhalin and at its southern Tsushima, the keystone of the arch
being the main island of Japan. This arch embraces the Sea
of Japan and is washed on its convex side by the Pacific Ocean.
Immediately after the transfer of Russia&rsquo;s naval base from
Nikolayevsk to Vladivostok, an attempt was made to obtain
possession of the southern point of the arch, namely, Tsushima.
A Russian man-of-war proceeded thither and quietly began to
establish a settlement, which would soon have constituted a
title of ownership had not Great Britain interfered. The
Russians saw that Vladivostok, acquired at the cost of so much
toil, would be comparatively useless unless from the sea on whose
shore it was situated an avenue to the Pacific could be opened,
and they therefore tried to obtain command of the Tsushima
channel. Immediately after reaching the mouth of the Amur
the same instinct had led them to begin the colonization of
Sakhalin. The axis of this long narrow island is inclined at a
very acute angle to the Usuri region, which its northern extremity
almost touches, while its southern is separated from Yezo
by the strait of La Pérouse. But in Sakhalin the Russians
found Japanese subjects. In fact the island was a part of the
Japanese empire. Resorting, however, to the Usuri fiction of
joint occupation, they succeeded by 1875 in transferring the whole
of Sakhalin to Russia&rsquo;s dominion. Further encroachments upon
Japanese territory could not be lightly essayed, and the Russians
held their hands. They had been trebly checked: checked in
trying to push southward along the coast of the mainland;
checked in trying to secure an avenue from Vladivostok to the
Pacific; and checked in their search for an ice-free port, which
definition Vladivostok did not fulfil. Enterprise in the direction
of Korea seemed to be the only hope of saving the maritime
results of the great Trans-Asian march.</p>

<p>Was Korea within safe range of such enterprises? Everything
seemed to answer in the affirmative. Korea had all the qualifications
desired by an aggressor. Her people were unprogressive,
her resources undeveloped, her self-defensive capacities
insignificant, her government corrupt. But she was a tributary
of China, and China had begun to show some tenacity in protecting
the integrity of her buffer states. Besides, Japan was
understood to have pretensions with regard to Korea. On the
whole, therefore, the problem of carrying to full fruition the
work of Muravief and his lieutenants demanded strength greater
than Russia could exercise without some line of communications
supplementing the Amur waterway and the long ocean route.
Therefore she set about the construction of a railway across
Asia.</p>

<p>The Amur being the boundary of Russia&rsquo;s east Asian territory,
this railway had to be carried along its northern bank where
many engineering and economic obstacles presented themselves.
Besides, the river, from an early stage in its course, makes a
huge semicircular sweep northward, and a railway following its
bank to Vladivostok must make the same détour. If, on the contrary,
the road could be carried over the diameter of the semicircle,
it would be a straight and therefore shorter line, technically
easier and economically better. The diameter, however, passed
through Chinese territory, and an excuse for extorting China&rsquo;s
permission was not in sight. Russia therefore proceeded to
build each end of the road, deferring the construction of the
Amur section for the moment. She had not waited long when,
in 1894, war broke out between China and Japan, and the latter,
completely victorious, demanded as the price of peace the
southern littoral of Manchuria from the Korean boundary to the
Liaotung peninsula at the entrance to the Gulf of Pechili. This
was a crisis in Russia&rsquo;s career. She saw that her maritime
extension could never get nearer to the Pacific than Vladivostok
were this claim of Japan&rsquo;s established. For the proposed
arrangement would place the littoral of Manchuria in Japan&rsquo;s
direct occupation and the littoral of Korea in her constructive
control, since not only had she fought to rescue Korea from
Chinese suzerainty, but also her object in demanding a slice of
the Manchurian coast-line was to protect Korea against aggression
from the north; that is to say, against aggression from
Russia. Muravief&rsquo;s enterprise had carried his country first to the
mouth of the Amur and thence southward along the coast
to Vladivostok and to Possiet Bay at the north-eastern extremity
of Korea. But it had not given to Russia free access to the
Pacific, and now she was menaced with a perpetual barrier to
that access, since the whole remaining coast of east Asia as far
as the Gulf of Pechili was about to pass into Japan&rsquo;s possession
or under her domination.</p>

<p>Then Russia took an extraordinary step. She persuaded
Germany and France to force Japan out of Manchuria. It is
not to be supposed that she frankly exposed her own aggressive
designs and asked for assistance to prosecute them. Neither
is it to be supposed that France and Germany were so curiously
deficient in perspicacity as to overlook those designs. At all
events these three great powers served on Japan a notice to quit,
and Japan, exhausted by her struggle with China, had no choice
but to obey.</p>

<p>The notice was accompanied by an <i>exposé</i> of reasons. Its
signatories said that Japan&rsquo;s tenure of the Manchurian littoral
would menace the security of the Chinese capital, would render
the independence of Korea illusory, and would constitute an
obstacle to the peace of the Orient.</p>

<p>By way of saving the situation in some slight degree Japan
sought from China a guarantee that no portion of Manchuria
should thereafter be leased or ceded to a foreign state. But
France warned Japan that to press such a demand would offend
Russia, and Russia declared that, for her part, she had no intention
of trespassing in Manchuria. Japan, had she been in a
position to insist on the guarantee, would also have been in a
position to disobey the mandate of the three powers. Unable
to do either the one or the other, she quietly stepped out of
Manchuria, and proceeded to double her army and treble her
navy.</p>

<p>As a reward for the assistance nominally rendered to China in
this matter, Russia obtained permission in Peking to divert her
Trans-Asian railway from the huge bend of the Amur to the
straight line through Manchuria. Neither Germany nor France
received any immediate recompense. Three years later, by
way of indemnity for the murder of two missionaries by a mob,
Germany seized a portion of the province of Shantung. Immediately,
on the principle that two wrongs make a right, Russia
obtained a lease of the Liaotung peninsula, from which she
had driven Japan in 1895. This act she followed by extorting
from China permission to construct a branch of the Trans-Asian
railway through Manchuria from north to south.</p>

<p>Russia&rsquo;s maritime aspirations had now assumed a radically
altered phase. Instead of pushing southward from Vladivostok
and Possiet Bay along the coast of Korea, she had suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
leaped the Korean peninsula and found access to the Pacific
in Liaotung. Nothing was wanting to establish her as practical
mistress of Manchuria except a plausible excuse for garrisoning
the place. Such an excuse was furnished by the Boxer rising in
1900. Its conclusion saw her in military occupation of the
whole region, and she might easily have made her occupation
permanent by prolonging it until peace and order should have
been fully restored. But here she fell into an error of judgment.
Imagining that the Chinese could be persuaded or intimidated to
any concession, she proposed a convention virtually recognizing
her title to Manchuria.</p>

<p>Japan watched all these things with profound anxiety. If
there were any reality in the dangers which Russia, Germany
and France had declared to be incidental to Japanese occupation
of a part of Manchuria, the same dangers must be doubly incidental
to Russian occupation of the whole of Manchuria&mdash;the
security of the Chinese capital would be threatened, and an
obstacle would be created to the permanent peace of the East.
The independence of Korea was an object of supreme solicitude
to Japan. Historically she held towards the little state a
relation closely resembling that of suzerain, and though of
her ancient conquests nothing remained except a settlement
at Fusan on the southern coast, her national sentiment would
have been deeply wounded by any foreign aggression in the
peninsula. It was to establish Korean independence that she
waged war with China in 1894; and her annexation of the Manchurian
littoral adjacent to the Korean frontier, after the war,
was designed to secure that independence, not to menace it as
the triple alliance professed to think. But if Russia came into
possession of all Manchuria, her subsequent absorption of Korea
would be almost inevitable. For the consideration set forth
above as to Vladivostok&rsquo;s maritime avenues would then acquire
absolute cogency. Manchuria is larger than France and the
United Kingdom lumped together. The addition of such an
immense area to Russia&rsquo;s east Asiatic dominions, together with
its littoral on the Gulf of Pechili and the Yellow Sea, would necessitate
a corresponding expansion of her naval forces in the Far
East. With the one exception of Port Arthur, however, the
Manchurian coast does not offer any convenient naval base. It
is only in the splendid harbours of southern Korea that such
bases can be found. Moreover, there would be an even stronger
motive impelling Russia towards Korea. Neither the Usuri
region nor the Manchurian littoral possesses so much as one
port qualified to satisfy her perennial longing for free access to
the ocean in a temperate zone. Without Korea, then, Russia&rsquo;s
east Asian expansion, though it added huge blocks of territory
to her dominions, would have been commercially incomplete and
strategically defective.</p>

<p>If it be asked why, apart from history and national sentiment,
Japan should object to a Russian Korea, the answer is, first,
because there would thus be planted almost within cannon-shot
of her shores a power of enormous strength and insatiable
ambition; secondly, because, whatever voice in Manchuria&rsquo;s
destiny Russia derived from her railway, the same voice in
Korea&rsquo;s destiny was possessed by Japan as the sole owner of
railways in the peninsula; thirdly, that whereas Russia had an
altogether insignificant share in the foreign commerce of Korea
and scarcely ten bona-fide settlers, Japan did the greater part of
the over-sea trade and had tens of thousands of settlers; fourthly,
that if Russia&rsquo;s dominions stretched uninterruptedly from the
Sea of Okhotsk to the Gulf of Pechili, her ultimate absorption of
north China would be as certain as sunrise; and fifthly, that
such domination and such absorption would involve the practical
closure of all that immense region to Japanese commerce and
industry as well as to the commerce and industry of every
Western nation except Russia. This last proposition did not
rest solely on the fact that to oppose artificial barriers to free
competition is Russia&rsquo;s sole hope of utilizing to her own benefit
any commercial opportunities brought within her reach. It
rested also on the fact that Russia had objected to foreign
settlements at the marts recently opened by treaty with China
to American and Japanese subjects. Without settlements,
trade at those marts would be impossible, and thus Russia had
constructively announced that there should be no trade but
Russian, if she could prevent it.</p>

<p>Against such dangers Japan would have been justified in
adopting any measure of self-protection. She had foreseen them
for six years, and had been strengthening herself to avert them.
But she wanted peace. She wanted to develop her material
resources and to accumulate some measure of wealth, without
which she must remain insignificant among the nations. Two
pacific devices offered, and she adopted them both. Russia,
instead of trusting time to consolidate her tenure of Manchuria,
had made the mistake of pragmatically importuning China for a
conventional title. If then Peking could be strengthened to
resist this demand, some arrangement of a distinctly terminable
nature might be made. The United States, Great Britain and
Japan, joining hands for that purpose, did succeed in so far
stiffening China&rsquo;s backbone that her show of resolution finally
induced Russia to sign a treaty pledging herself to withdraw
her troops from Manchuria in three instalments, each step of
evacuation to be accomplished by a fixed date. That was one
of the pacific devices. The other suggested itself in connexion
with the new commercial treaties which China had promised to
negotiate in the sequel of the Boxer troubles. In these documents
clauses provided for the opening of three places in Manchuria
to foreign trade. It seemed a reasonable hope that,
having secured commercial access to Manchuria by covenant
with its sovereign, China, the powers would not allow Russia
arbitrarily to restrict their privileges. It seemed also a reasonable
hope that Russia, having solemnly promised to evacuate
Manchuria at fixed dates, would fulfil her engagement.</p>

<p>The latter hope was signally disappointed. When the time
came for evacuation, Russia behaved as though no promise
had ever been given. She proposed wholly new conditions,
which would have strengthened her grasp of Manchuria instead
of loosening it. China being powerless to offer any practical
protest, and Japan&rsquo;s interests ranking next in order of importance,
the T&#333;ky&#333; government approached Russia direct. They
did not ask for anything that could hurt her pride or injure
her position. Appreciating fully the economical status she had
acquired in Manchuria by large outlays of capital, they offered
to recognize that status, provided that Russia would extend
similar recognition to Japan&rsquo;s status in Korea, would promise,
in common with Japan, to respect the sovereignty and the
territorial integrity of China and Korea, and would be a party
to a mutual engagement that all nations should have equal
industrial and commercial opportunities in Manchuria and the
Korean peninsula. In a word, they invited Russia to subscribe
the policy enunciated by the United States and Great Britain,
the policy of the open door and of the integrity of the Chinese
and Korean empires.</p>

<p>Thus commenced a negotiation which lasted five and a half
months. Japan gradually reduced her demands to a minimum.
Russia never made the smallest appreciable concession. She
refused to listen to Japan for one moment about Manchuria.
Eight years previously Japan had been in military possession of
Manchuria, and Russia with the assistance of Germany and
France had expelled her for reasons which concerned Japan
incomparably more than they concerned any of the three
powers&mdash;the security of the Chinese capital, the independence of
Korea, the peace of the East. Now, Russia had the splendid
assurance to declare by implication that none of these things
concerned Japan at all. The utmost she would admit was
Japan&rsquo;s partial right to be heard about Korea. And at the same
time she herself commenced in northern Korea a series of aggressions,
partly perhaps to show her potentialities, partly by way
of counter-irritant. That was not all. Whilst she studiously
deferred her answers to Japan&rsquo;s proposals and protracted the
negotiations to an extent which was actually contumelious,
she hastened to send eastward a big fleet of war-ships and a new
army of soldiers. It was impossible for the dullest politician
to mistake her purpose. She intended to yield nothing, but
to prepare such a parade of force that her obduracy would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
command submission. The only alternatives for Japan were war
or total and permanent effacement in Asia. She chose war,
and in fighting it she fought the battle of free and equal opportunities
for all without undue encroachment upon the sovereign
rights or territorial integrity of China or Korea, against a military
dictatorship, a programme of ruthless territorial aggrandizement
and a policy of selfish restrictions.</p>

<p>The details of the great struggle that ensued are given elsewhere
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Russo-Japanese War</a></span>). After the battle of Mukden
the belligerents found themselves in a position which
must either prelude another stupendous effort on
<span class="sidenote">The Results of the War.</span>
both sides or be utilized for the purpose of peace
negotiations. At this point the president of the
United States of America intervened in the interests of
humanity, and on the 9th of June 1905 instructed the
United States&rsquo; representative in T&#333;ky&#333; to urge that the
Japanese government should open direct negotiations with
Russia, an exactly corresponding note being simultaneously
sent to the Russian government through the United States&rsquo;
representative in St Petersburg. Japan&rsquo;s reply was made on
the 10th of June. It intimated frank acquiescence, and Russia
lost no time in taking a similar step. Nevertheless two
months elapsed before the plenipotentiaries of the belligerents
met, on the 10th of August, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
U.S.A. Russia sent M. (afterwards Count) de Witte and
Baron Rosen; Japan, Baron (afterwards Count) Komura,
who had held the portfolio of foreign affairs throughout the
war, and Mr. (afterwards Baron) Takahira. In entering
this conference, Japanese statesmen, as was subsequently
known, saw clearly that a great part of the credit accruing
to them for their successful conduct of the war would be
forfeited in the sequel of the negotiations. For the people
of Japan had accustomed themselves to expect that Russia
would assuredly recoup the expenses incurred by their country in
the contest, whereas the cabinet in T&#333;ky&#333; understood well that to
look for payment of indemnity by a great state whose territory
had not been invaded effectively nor its existence menaced
must be futile. Nevertheless, diplomacy required that this
conviction should be concealed, and thus Russia carried to the
conference a belief that the financial phase of the discussion
would be crucial, while, at the same time, the Japanese nation
reckoned fully on an indemnity of 150 millions sterling. Baron
Komura&rsquo;s mandate was, however, that the only radically
essential terms were those formulated by Japan prior to the war.
She must insist on securing the ends for which she had fought,
since she believed them to be indispensable to the peace of the
Far East, but she would not demand anything more. The
Japanese plenipotentiary, therefore, judged it wise to marshal
his terms in the order of their importance, leaving his Russian
colleague to imagine, as he probably would, that the converse
method had been adopted, and that everything preliminary
to the questions of finance and territory was of minor consequence.
The negotiations, commencing on the 10th of August,
were not concluded until the 5th of September, when a treaty of
peace was signed. There had been a moment when the onlooking
world believed that unless Russia agreed to ransom the island
of Sakhalin by paying to Japan a sum of 120 millions sterling,
the conference would be broken off; nor did such an exchange
seem unreasonable, for were Russia expelled from the northern
part of Sakhalin, which commands the estuary of the Amur
River, her position in Siberia would have been compromised.
But the statesmen who directed Japan&rsquo;s affairs were not disposed
to make any display of earth-hunger. The southern half
of Sakhalin had originally belonged to Japan and had passed
into Russia&rsquo;s possession by an arrangement which the Japanese
nation strongly resented. To recover that portion of the
island seemed, therefore, a legitimate ambition. Japan did
not contemplate any larger demand, nor did she seriously insist
on an indemnity. Therefore the negotiations were never
in real danger of failure. The treaty of Portsmouth recognized
Japan&rsquo;s &ldquo;paramount political, military and economic
interests&rdquo; in Korea; provided for the simultaneous evacuation
of Manchuria by the contracting parties; transferred to Japan
the lease of the Liaotung peninsula held by Russia from China
together with the Russian railways south of Kwang-Cheng-tsze
and all collateral mining or other privileges; ceded to Japan
the southern half of Sakhalin, the 50th parallel of latitude
to be the boundary between the two parts; secured fishing
rights for Japanese subjects along the coasts of the seas of
Japan, Okhotsk and Bering; laid down that the expenses
incurred by the Japanese for the maintenance of the Russian
prisoners during the war should be reimbursed by Russia,
less the outlays made by the latter on account of Japanese
prisoners&mdash;by which arrangement Japan obtained a payment
of some 4 millions sterling&mdash;and provided that the contracting
parties, while withdrawing their military forces from Manchuria,
might maintain guards to protect their respective railways,
the number of such guards not to exceed 15 per kilometre of
line. There were other important restrictions: first, the contracting
parties were to abstain from taking, on the Russo-Korean
frontier, any military measures which might menace
the security of Russian or Korean territory; secondly, the two
powers pledged themselves not to exploit the Manchurian
railways for strategic purposes; and thirdly, they promised
not to build on Sakhalin or its adjacent islands any fortifications
or other similar military works, or to take any military measures
which might impede the free navigation of the straits of La
Pérouse and the Gulf of Tartary. The above provisions concerned
the two contracting parties only. But China&rsquo;s interests
also were considered. Thus it was agreed to &ldquo;restore entirely
and completely to her exclusive administration&rdquo; all portions of
Manchuria then in the occupation, or under the control, of
Japanese or Russian troops, except the leased territory; that her
consent must be obtained for the transfer to Japan of the leases
and concessions held by the Russians in Manchuria; that the
Russian government would disavow the possession of &ldquo;any
territorial advantages or preferential or exclusive concessions
in impairment of Chinese sovereignty or inconsistent with the
principle of equal opportunity in Manchuria&rdquo;; and that Japan
and Russia &ldquo;engaged reciprocally not to obstruct any general
measures common to all countries which China might take
for the development of the commerce and industry of Manchuria.&rdquo;
This distinction between the special interests of the
contracting parties and the interests of China herself as well
as of foreign nations generally is essential to clear understanding
of a situation which subsequently attracted much attention.
From the time of the opium war (1857) to the Boxer rising (1900)
each of the great Western powers struggled for its own hand in
China, and each sought to gain for itself exclusive concessions
and privileges with comparatively little regard for the interests
of others, and with no regard whatever for China&rsquo;s sovereign
rights. The fruits of this period were: permanently ceded territories
(Hong-Kong and Macao); leases temporarily establishing
foreign sovereignty in various districts (Kiaochow, Wei-hai-wei
and Kwang-chow); railway and mining concessions; and the
establishment of settlements at open ports where foreign
jurisdiction was supreme. But when, in 1900, the Boxer rising
forced all the powers into a common camp, they awoke to full
appreciation of a principle which had been growing current
for the past two or three years, namely, that concerted action
on the lines of maintaining China&rsquo;s integrity and securing to
all alike equality of opportunity and a similarly open door,
was the only feasible method of preventing the partition of
the Chinese Empire and averting a clash of rival interests which
might have disastrous results. This, of course, did not mean
that there was to be any abandonment of special privileges
already acquired or any surrender of existing concessions.
The arrangement was not to be retrospective in any sense.
Vested interests were to be strictly guarded until the lapse
of the periods for which they had been granted, or until the
maturity of China&rsquo;s competence to be really autonomous. A
curious situation was thus created. International professions of
respect for China&rsquo;s sovereignty, for the integrity of her empire
and for the enforcement of the open door and equal opportunity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
coexisted with legacies from an entirely different past. Russia
endorsed this new policy, but not unnaturally declined to
abate any of the advantages previously enjoyed by her
in Manchuria. Those advantages were very substantial.
They included a twenty-five years&rsquo; lease&mdash;with provision for
renewal&mdash;of the Liaotung peninsula, within which area of
1220 sq. m. Chinese troops might not penetrate, whereas
Russia would not only exercise full administrative authority,
but also take military and naval action of any kind; they
included the creation of a neutral territory in the immediate
north of the former and still more extensive, which should remain
under Chinese administration, but where neither Chinese nor
Russian troops might enter, nor might China, without Russia&rsquo;s
consent, cede land, open trading marts or grant concessions to
any third nationality; and they included the right to build
some 1600 m. of railway (which China would have the opportunity
of purchasing at cost price in the year 1938 and would be
entitled to receive gratis in 1982), as well as the right to hold
extensive zones on either side of the railway, to administer these
zones in the fullest sense, and to work all mines lying along the
lines. Under the Portsmouth treaty these advantages were
transferred to Japan by Russia, the railway, however, being
divided so that only the portion (521½ m.) to the south of
Kwang-Cheng-tsze fell to Japan&rsquo;s share, while the portion
(1077 m.) to the north of that place remained in Russia&rsquo;s
hands. China&rsquo;s consent to the above transfers and assignments
was obtained in a treaty signed at Peking on the 22nd of
December 1905. Thus Japan came to hold in Manchuria a
position somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, she figured
as the champion of the Chinese Empire&rsquo;s integrity and as an
exponent of the new principle of equal opportunity and the
open door. On the other, she appeared as the legatee of many
privileges more or less inconsistent with that principle. But,
at the same time, nearly all the great powers of Europe were
similarly circumstanced. In their cases also the same incongruity
was observable between the newly professed policy
and the aftermath of the old practice. It was scarcely to be
expected that Japan alone should make a large sacrifice on the
altar of a theory to which no other state thought of yielding
any retrospective obedience whatever. She did, indeed,
furnish a clear proof of deference to the open-door doctrine,
for instead of reserving the railway zones to her own exclusive
use, as she was fully entitled to do, she sought and obtained
from China a pledge to open to foreign trade 16 places within
those zones. For the rest, however, the inconsistency between
the past and the present, though existing throughout the
whole of China, was nowhere so conspicuous as in the three
eastern provinces (Manchuria); not because there was any real
difference of degree, but because Manchuria had been the scene
of the greatest war of modern times; because that war had been
fought by Japan in the cause of the new policy, and because
the principles of the equally open door and of China&rsquo;s integrity
had been the main bases of the Portsmouth treaty, of the Anglo-Japanese
alliance, and of the subsequently concluded <i>ententes</i>
with France and Russia. In short, the world&rsquo;s eyes were fixed
on Manchuria and diverted from China proper, so that every act
of Japan was subjected to an exceptionally rigorous scrutiny,
and the nations behaved as though they expected her to live up
to a standard of almost ideal altitude. China&rsquo;s mood, too,
greatly complicated the situation. She had the choice between
two moderate and natural courses: either to wait quietly until
the various concessions granted by her to foreign powers in
the evil past should lapse by maturity, or to qualify herself by
earnest reforms and industrious development for their earlier
recovery. Nominally she adopted the latter course, but in
reality she fell into a mood of much impatience. Under the name
of a &ldquo;rights-recovery campaign&rdquo; her people began to protest
vehemently against the continuance of any conditions which
impaired her sovereignty, and as this temper coloured her
attitude towards the various questions which inevitably grew
out of the situation in Manchuria, her relations with Japan
became somewhat strained in the early part of 1909.</p>

<p>Having waged two wars on account of Korea, Japan emerged
from the second conflict with the conviction that the policy of
maintaining the independence of Korea must be
modified, and that since the identity of Korean and
<span class="sidenote">Japan in Korea after the War with Russia.</span>
Japanese interests in the Far East and the paramount
character of Japanese interests in Korea would not
permit Japan to leave Korea to the care of any third
power, she must assume the charge herself. Europe and
America also recognized that view of the situation, and consented
to withdraw their legations from Seoul, thus leaving the control
of Korean foreign affairs entirely in the hands of Japan, who
further undertook to assume military direction in the event of
aggression from without or disturbance from within. But in
the matter of internal administration she continued to limit
herself to advisory supervision. Thus, though a Japanese
resident-general in Seoul, with subordinate residents throughout
the provinces, assumed the functions hitherto discharged by
foreign representatives and consuls, the Korean government was
merely asked to employ Japanese experts in the position of
counsellors, the right to accept or reject their counsels being left
to their employers. Once again, however, the futility of looking
for any real reforms under this optional system was demonstrated.
Japan sent her most renowned statesman, Prince Ito,
to discharge the duties of resident-general; but even he, in spite
of profound patience and tact, found that some less optional
methods must be resorted to. Hence on the 24th of July 1907
a new agreement was signed, by which the resident-general
acquired initiative as well as consultative competence to enact
and enforce laws and ordinances, to appoint and remove Korean
officials, and to place capable Japanese subjects in the ranks of
the administration. That this constituted a heavy blow to
Korea&rsquo;s independence could not be gainsaid. That it was inevitable
seemed to be equally obvious. For there existed in
Korea nearly all the worst abuses of medieval systems. The
administration of justice depended solely on favour or interest.
The police contributed by corruption and incompetence to the
insecurity of life and property. The troops were a body of useless
mercenaries. Offices being allotted by sale, thousands of
incapables thronged the ranks of the executive. The emperor&rsquo;s
court was crowded by diviners and plotters of all kinds, male
and female. The finances of the throne and those of the state
were hopelessly confused. There was nothing like an organized
judiciary. A witness was in many cases considered <i>particeps
criminis</i>; torture was commonly employed to obtain evidence,
and defendants in civil cases were placed under arrest. Imprisonment
meant death or permanent disablement for a man of
small means. Flogging so severe as to cripple, if not to kill,
was a common punishment; every major offence from robbery
upward was capital, and female criminals were frequently executed
by administering shockingly painful poisons. The currency
was in a state of the utmost confusion. Extreme corruption
and extortion were practised in connexion with taxation.
Finally, while nothing showed that the average Korean lacked
the elementary virtue of patriotism, there had been repeated
proofs that the safety and independence of the empire counted
for little in the estimates of political intriguers. Japan must
either step out of Korea altogether or effect drastic reforms
there. She necessarily chose the latter alternative, and the
things which she accomplished between the beginning of 1906
and the close of 1908 may be briefly described as the elaboration
of a proper system of taxation; the organization of a staff to
administer annual budgets; the re-assessment of taxable property;
the floating of public loans for productive enterprises;
the reform of the currency; the establishment of banks of
various kinds, including agricultural and commercial; the
creation of associations for putting bank-notes into circulation;
the introduction of a warehousing system to supply capital to
farmers; the lighting and buoying of the coasts; the provision
of posts, telegraphs, roads and railways; the erection of public
buildings; the starting of various industrial enterprises (such as
printing, brick-making, forestry and coal-mining); the laying
out of model farms; the beginning of cotton cultivation; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
building and equipping of an industrial training school; the
inauguration of sanitary works; the opening of hospitals and
medical schools; the organization of an excellent educational
system; the construction of waterworks in several towns; the
complete remodelling of the central government; the differentiation
of the court and the executive, as well as of the administration
and the judiciary; the formation of an efficient body of
police; the organization of law courts with a majority of Japanese
jurists on the bench; the enactment of a new penal code;
drastic reforms in the taxation system. In the summer of 1907
the resident-general advised the Throne to disband the standing
army as an unserviceable and expensive force. The measure was
doubtless desirable, but the docility of the troops had been over-rated.
Some of them resisted vehemently, and many became
the nucleus of an insurrection which lasted in a desultory manner
for nearly two years; cost the lives of 21,000 insurgents and
1300 Japanese; and entailed upon Japan an outlay of nearly a
million sterling. Altogether Japan was 15 millions sterling out
of pocket on Korea&rsquo;s account by the end of 1909. She had
also lost the veteran statesman Prince Ito, who was assassinated
at Harbin by a Korean fanatic on the 26th of October 1909.
Finally an end was put to an anomalous situation by the annexation
of Korea to Japan on the 29th of August 1910. (See
further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Korea</a></span>.)</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">IX.&mdash;Domestic History</p>

<p><i>Cosmography.</i>&mdash;Japanese annals represent the first inhabitant
of earth as a direct descendant of the gods. Two books describe
the events of the &ldquo;Divine age.&rdquo; One, compiled in 712, is called
the <i>Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)</i>; the other, compiled
in 720, is called the <i>Nihongi</i> (<i>Chronicles of Japan</i>). Both
describe the processes of creation, but the author of the <i>Chronicles</i>
drew largely upon Chinese traditions, whereas the compilers of
the <i>Records</i> appear to have limited themselves to materials
which they believed to be native. The <i>Records</i>, therefore, have
always been regarded as the more trustworthy guide to pure
Japanese conceptions. They deal with the creation of Japan
only, other countries having been apparently judged unworthy of
attention. At the beginning of all things a primordial trinity
is represented as existing on the &ldquo;plain of high heaven.&rdquo; Thereafter,
during an indefinite time and by an indefinite process,
other deities come into existence, their titles indicating a vague
connexion with constructive and fertilizing forces. They are
not immortal: it is explicitly stated that they ultimately pass
away, and the idea of the cosmographers seems to be that each
deity marks a gradual approach to human methods of procreation.
Meanwhile the earth is &ldquo;young and, like floating
oil, drifts about after the manner of a jelly-fish.&rdquo; At last there
are born two deities, the creator and the creatress, and these
receive the mandate of all the heavenly beings to &ldquo;make,
consolidate and give birth to the drifting land.&rdquo; For use in
that work a jewelled spear is given to them, and, standing upon
the bridge that connects heaven and earth, they thrust downwards
with the weapon, stir the brine below and draw up the
spear, when from its point fall drops which, accumulating, form
the first dry land. Upon this land the two deities descend, and,
by ordinary processes, beget the islands of Japan as well as
numerous gods representing the forces of nature. But in giving
birth to the god of fire the creatress (Izanami) perishes, and the
creator (Izanagi) makes his way to the under-world in search of
her&mdash;an obvious parallel to the tales of Ishtar and Orpheus.
With difficulty he returns to earth, and, as he washes himself
from the pollution of Hades, there are born from the turbid water
a number of evil deities succeeded by a number of good, just
as in the Babylonian cosmogony the primordial ocean, Tiamat,
brings forth simultaneously gods and imps. Finally, as Izanagi
washes his left eye the Goddess of the Sun comes into existence;
as he washes his right, the God of the Moon; and as he washes
his nose, the God of Force. To these three he assigns, respectively,
the dominion of the sun, the dominion of the moon, and
the dominion of the ocean. But the god of force (Sosanoo), like
Lucifer, rebels against this decree, creates a commotion in
heaven, and after having been the cause of the temporary
seclusion of the sun goddess and the consequent wrapping of the
world in darkness, kills the goddess of food and is permanently
banished from heaven by the host of deities. He descends to
Izumo on the west of the main island of Japan, and there saves
a maiden from an eight-headed serpent. Sosanoo himself passes
to the under-world and becomes the deity of Hades, but he
invests one of his descendants with the sovereignty of Japan,
and the title is established after many curious adventures. To
the sun goddess also, whose feud with her fierce brother survives
the latter&rsquo;s banishment from heaven, the idea of making
her grandson ruler of Japan presents itself. She despatches three
embassies to impose her will upon the descendants of Sosanoo,
and finally her grandson descends, not, however, in Izumo,
where the demi-gods of Sosanoo&rsquo;s race hold sway, but in Hi&#363;ga
in the southern island of Ki&#363;shi&#363;. This grandson of Amaterasu
(the goddess of the sun) is called Ninigi, whose great-grandson
figures in Japanese history as the first human sovereign of the
country, known during life as Kamu-Yamato-Iware-Biko, and
given the name of Jimmu tenn&#333; (Jimmu, son of heaven)
fourteen centuries after his death. Japanese annalists attribute
the accession of Jimmu to the year 660 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Why that date was
chosen must remain a matter of conjecture. The <i>Records of
Ancient Matters</i> has no chronology, but the more pretentious
writers of the <i>Chronicles of Japan</i>, doubtless in imitation of their
Chinese models, considered it necessary to assign a year, a
month, and even a day for each event of importance. There
is abundant reason, however, to question the accuracy of all
Japanese chronology prior to the 5th century. The first date
corroborated by external evidence is 461, and Aston, who has
made a special study of the subject, concludes that the year
500 may be taken as the time when the chronology of the
<i>Chronicles</i> begins to be trustworthy. Many Japanese, however,
are firm believers in the <i>Chronicles</i>, and when assigning the
year of the empire they invariably take 660 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> for starting-point,
so that 1909 of the Gregorian calendar becomes for
them 2569.</p>

<p><i>Prehistoric Period</i>.&mdash;Thus, if the most rigid estimate be
accepted, the space of 1160 years, from 660 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 500, may
be called the prehistoric period. During that long interval
the annals include 24 sovereigns, the first 17 of whom lived for
over a hundred years on the average. It seems reasonable to
conclude that the so-called assignment of the sovereignty of
Japan to Sosanoo&rsquo;s descendants and the establishment of
their kingdom in Izumo represent an invasion of Mongolian
immigrants coming from the direction of the Korean peninsula&mdash;indeed
one of the <i>Nihongi&rsquo;s</i> versions of the event actually
indicates Korea as the point of departure&mdash;and that the subsequent
descent of Ninigi on Mount Takachiho in Hi&#363;ga indicates
the advent of a body of Malayan settlers from the south sea.
Jimmu, according to the <i>Chronicles</i>, set out from Hi&#363;ga in
667 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and was not crowned at his new palace in Yamato until
660. This campaign of seven years is described in some detail,
but no satisfactory information is given as to the nature of the
craft in which the invader and his troops voyaged, or as to
the number of men under his command. The weapons said
to have been carried were bows, spears and swords. A supernatural
element is imported into the narrative in the form of the
three-legged crow of the sun, which Amaterasu sends down to
act as guide and messenger for her descendants. Jimmu died
at his palace of Kashiwa-bara in 585 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, his age being 127
according to the <i>Chronicles</i>, and 137 according to the <i>Records</i>.
He was buried in a kind of tomb called <i>misasagi</i>, which seems to
have been in use in Japan for some centuries before the Christian
era&mdash;&ldquo;a highly specialized form of tumulus, consisting of
two mounds, one having a circular, the other a triangular base,
which merged into each other, the whole being surrounded by a
moat, or sometimes by two concentric moats with a narrow
strip of land between. In some, perhaps in most, cases the
misasagi contains a large vault of great unhewn stones without
mortar. The walls of this vault converge gradually towards the
top, which is roofed in by enormous slabs of stone weighing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
many tons each. The entrance is by means of a gallery
roofed with similar stones.&rdquo; Several of these ancient sepulchral
mounds have been examined during recent years, and their
contents have furnished information of much antiquarian
interest, though there is a complete absence of inscriptions.
The reigns of the eight sovereigns who succeeded Jimmu were
absolutely uneventful. Nothing is set down except the genealogy
of each ruler, the place of his residence and his burial,
his age and the date of his death. It was then the custom&mdash;and
it remained so until the 8th century of the Christian era&mdash;to
change the capital on the accession of each emperor; a habit
which effectually prevented the growth of any great metropolis.
The reign of the 10th emperor, S&#363;jin, lasted from 98 to 30 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
During his era the land was troubled by pestilence and the
people broke out in rebellion; calamities which were supposed
to be caused by the spirit of the ancient ruler of Izumo to avenge
a want of consideration shown to his descendants by their
supplanters. Divination&mdash;by a Chinese process&mdash;and visions
revealed the source of trouble; rites of worship were performed
in honour of the ancient ruler, his descendant being entrusted
with the duty, and the pestilence ceased. We now hear for the
first time of vigorous measures to quell the aboriginal savages,
doubtless the Ainu. Four generals are sent out against them in
different directions. But the expedition is interrupted by an
armed attempt on the part of the emperor&rsquo;s half-brother, who,
utilizing the opportunity of the troops&rsquo; absence from Yamato,
marches from Yamashiro at the head of a powerful army to
win the crown for himself. In connexion with these incidents,
curious evidence is furnished of the place then assigned to
woman by the writers of the <i>Chronicles</i>. It is a girl who warns
one of the emperor&rsquo;s generals of the plot; it is the sovereign&rsquo;s
aunt who interprets the warning; and it is Ata, the wife of the
rebellious prince, who leads the left wing of his army. Four
other noteworthy facts are recorded of this reign: the taking
of a census; the imposition of a tax on animals&rsquo; skins and game
to be paid by men, and on textile fabrics by women; the
building of boats for coastwise transport, and the digging of
dikes and reservoirs for agricultural purposes. All these
things rest solely on the testimony of annalists writing eight
centuries later than the era they discuss and compiling their
narrative mostly from tradition. Careful investigations have
been made to ascertain whether the histories of China and Korea
corroborate or contradict those of Japan. Without entering
into detailed evidence, the inference may be at once stated that
the dates given in Japanese early history are just 120 years too
remote; an error very likely to occur when using the sexagenary
cycle, which constituted the first method of reckoning time in
Japan. But although this correction suffices to reconcile some
contradictory features of Far-Eastern history, it does not constitute
any explanation of the incredible longevity assigned by the
<i>Chronicles</i> to several Japanese sovereigns, and the conclusion is
that when a consecutive record of reigns came to be compiled
in the 8th century, many lacunae were found which had to be
filled up from the imagination of the compilers. With this
parenthesis we may pass rapidly over the events of the next
two centuries (29 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200). They are remarkable for
vigorous measures to subdue the aboriginal Ainu, who in the
southern island of Ki&#363;shi&#363; are called Kuma-so (the names of two
tribes) and sometimes earth-spiders (<i>i.e.</i> cave-dwellers), while
in the north-eastern regions of the main island they are designated
Yemishi. Expeditions are led against them in both
regions by Prince Yamato-dake, a hero revered by all succeeding
generations of Japanese as the type of valour and loyalty.
Dying from the effects of hardship and exposure, but declaring
with his last breath that loss of life was as nothing compared
with the sorrow of seeing his father&rsquo;s face no more, his spirit
ascends to heaven as a white bird, and when his son, Ch&#363;ai,
comes to the throne, he causes cranes to be placed in the moat
surrounding his palace in memory of his illustrious sire.</p>

<p>The sovereign had partly ceased to follow the example of
Jimmu, who led his armies in person. The emperors did not,
however, pass a sedentary life. They frequently made progresses
throughout their dominions, and on these occasions a
not uncommon incident was the addition of some local beauty to
the Imperial harem. This licence had a far-reaching effect,
since to provide for the sovereign&rsquo;s numerous offspring&mdash;the
emperor Keik&#333; (71-130) had 80 children&mdash;no better way offered
than to make grants of land, and thus were laid the foundations
of a territorial nobility destined profoundly to influence the course
of Japanese history. Woman continues to figure conspicuously
in the story. The image of the sun goddess, enshrined in Ise
(5 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), is entrusted to the keeping of a princess, as are the
mirror, sword and jewel inherited from the sun goddess; a woman
(Tachibana) accompanies Prince Yamato-dake in his campaign
against the Yemishi, and sacrifices her life to quell a tempest at
sea; Saho, consort of Suinin, is the heroine of a most tragic tale
in which the conflict between filial piety and conjugal loyalty
leads to her self-destruction; and a woman is found ruling over
a large district in Ki&#363;sh&#363; when the Emperor Keik&#333; is engaged
in his campaign against the aborigines. The reign of Suinin
saw the beginning of an art destined to assume extraordinary
importance in Japan&mdash;the art of wrestling&mdash;and the first champion,
Nomi no Sukune, is honoured for having suggested that
clay figures should take the place of the human sacrifices hitherto
offered at the sepulture of Imperial personages. The irrigation
works commenced in the time of S&#363;jin were zealously continued
under his two immediate successors, Suinin and Keik&#333;. More
than 800 ponds and channels are described as having been constructed
under the former&rsquo;s rule. We find evidence also that
the sway of the throne had been by this time widely extended,
for in 125 a governor-general of 15 provinces is nominated, and
two years later, governors (<i>miyakko</i>) are appointed in every
province and mayors (<i>inaki</i>) in every village. The number or
names of these local divisions are not given, but it is explained
that mountains and rivers were taken as boundaries of provinces,
the limits of towns and villages being marked by roads running
respectively east and west, north and south.</p>

<p>An incident is now reached which the Japanese count a landmark
in their history, though foreign critics are disposed to regard
it as apocryphal. It is the invasion of Korea by a
Japanese army under the command of the empress
<span class="sidenote">Invasion of Korea.</span>
Jingo, in 200. The emperor Ch&#363;ai, having proceeded to
Ki&#363;shi&#363; for the purpose of conducting a campaign against the
Kuma-so, is there joined by the empress, who, at the inspiration
of a deity, seeks to divert the Imperial arms against Korea.
But the emperor refuses to believe in the existence of any such
country, and heaven punishes his incredulity with death at the
hands of the Kuma-so, according to one account; from the effects
of disease, according to another. The calamity is concealed;
the Kuma-so are subdued, and the empress, having collected a
fleet and raised an army, crosses to the state of Silla (in Korea),
where, at the spectacle of her overwhelming strength, the
Korean monarch submits without fighting, and swears that until
the sun rises in the west, until rivers run towards their sources,
and until pebbles ascend to the sky and become stars, he
will do homage and send tribute to Japan. His example is
followed by the kings of the two other states constituting the
Korean peninsula, and the warlike empress returns triumphant.
Many supernatural elements embellish the tale, but the features
which chiefly discredit it are that it abounds in anachronisms,
and that the event, despite its signal importance, is not mentioned
in either Chinese or Korean history. It is certain that China
then possessed in Korea territory administered by Chinese
governors. She must therefore have had cognisance of such an
invasion, had it occurred. Moreover, Korean history mentions
twenty-five raids made by the Japanese against Silla during the
first five centuries of the Christian era, but not one of them can
be <span class="correction" title="amended from indentified">identified</span> with Jingo&rsquo;s alleged expedition. There can be no
doubt that the early Japanese were an aggressive, enterprising
people, and that their nearest over-sea neighbour suffered much
from their activity. Nor can there be any reasonable doubt that
the Jingo tale contains a large germ of truth, and is at least an
echo of the relations that existed between Japan and Korea in the
3rd and 4th centuries. The records of the 69 years comprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
Jingo&rsquo;s reign are in the main an account of intercourse, sometimes
peaceful, sometimes stormy, between the neighbouring
countries. Only one other episode occupies a prominent
place: it is an attempt on the part of Jingo&rsquo;s step-brothers to
oppose her return to Yamato and to prevent the accession of
her son to the throne. It should be noted here that all such
names as Jimmu, S&#363;jin, Ch&#363;ai, &amp;c., are posthumous, and were
invented in the reign of Kwammu (782-806), the fashion being
taken from China and the names themselves being purely Chinese
translations of the qualities assigned to the respective monarchs.
Thus Jimmu signifies &ldquo;divine valour&rdquo;; S&#363;jin, &ldquo;deity-honouring&rdquo;;
and Ch&#363;ai, &ldquo;sad middle son.&rdquo; The names of these
rulers during life were wholly different from their posthumous
appellations.</p>

<p>Chinese history, which is incomparably older and more precise
than Korean, is by no means silent about Japan. Long notices
occur in the later Han and Wei records (25 to 265).
The Japanese are spoken of as dwarfs (<i>Wa</i>), and
<span class="sidenote">Earliest Notices in Chinese History.</span>
their islands, frequently called the queen country, are
said to be mountainous, with soil suitable for growing
grain, hemp, and the silkworm mulberry. The climate is so mild
that vegetables can be grown in winter and summer; there are
neither oxen, horses, tigers, nor leopards; the people understand
the art of weaving; the men tattoo their faces and bodies in patterns
indicating differences of rank; male attire consists of a single
piece of cloth; females wear a gown passed over the head, and tie
their hair in a bow; soldiers are armed with spears and shields,
and also with bows, from which they discharge arrows tipped with
bone or iron; the sovereign resides in Yamato; there are stockaded
forts and houses; food is taken with the fingers but is served on
bamboo trays and wooden trenchers; foot-gear is not worn; when
men of the lower classes meet a man of rank, they leave the road
and retire to the grass, squatting or kneeling with both hands on
the ground when they address him; intoxicating liquor is much
used; the people are long-lived, many reaching the age of 100;
women are more numerous than men; there is no theft, and litigation
is infrequent; the women are faithful and not jealous;
all men of high rank have four or five wives, others two or three;
wives and children of law-breakers are confiscated, and for grave
crimes the offender&rsquo;s family is extirpated; divination is practised
by burning bones; mourning lasts for some ten days and the
rites are performed by a &ldquo;mourning-keeper&rdquo;; after a funeral
the whole family perform ablutions; fishing is much practised,
and the fishermen are skilled divers; there are distinctions of
rank and some are vassals to others; each province has a market
where goods are exchanged; the country is divided into more
than 100 provinces, and among its products are white pearls,
green jade and cinnabar. These annals go on to say that
between 147 and 190 civil war prevailed for several years, and
order was finally restored by a female sovereign, who is described
as having been old and unmarried; much addicted to magic arts;
attended by a thousand females; dwelling in a palace with lofty
pavilions surrounded by a stockade and guarded by soldiers;
but leading such a secluded life that few saw her face except one
man who served her meals and acted as a medium of communication.
There can be little question that this queen was the
empress Jingo who, according to Japanese annals, came to the
throne in the year <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200, and whose every public act had its
inception or promotion in some alleged divine interposition.
In one point, however, the Chinese historians are certainly
incorrect. They represent tattooing as universal in ancient
Japan, whereas it was confined to criminals, in whose case it
played the part that branding does elsewhere. Centuries later,
in feudal days, the habit came to be practised by men of the
lower orders whose avocations involved baring the body, but
it never acquired vogue among educated people. In other
respects these ancient Chinese annals must be credited with
remarkable accuracy in their description of Japan and the
Japanese. Their account may be advantageously compared
with Professor Chamberlain&rsquo;s analysis of the manners and
customs of the early Japanese, in the preface to his translation
of the <i>Kojiki</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The Japanese of the mythical period, as pictured in the legends
preserved by the compiler of the <i>Records of Ancient Matters</i>, were a
race who had long emerged from the savage stage and had attained
to a high level of barbaric skill. The Stone Age was forgotten by
them&mdash;or nearly so&mdash;and the evidence points to their never having
passed through a genuine Bronze Age, though the knowledge of
bronze was at a later period introduced from the neighbouring
continent. They used iron for manufacturing spears, swords and
knives of various shapes, and likewise for the more peaceful purpose
of making hooks wherewith to angle or to fasten the doors of their
huts. Their other warlike and hunting implements (besides traps
and gins, which appear to have been used equally for catching
beasts and birds and for destroying human enemies) were bows and
arrows, spears and elbow-pads&mdash;the latter seemingly of skin, while
special allusion is made to the fact that the arrows were feathered.
Perhaps clubs should be added to the list. Of the bows and arrows,
swords and knives, there is perpetual mention, but nowhere do we
hear of the tools with which they were manufactured, and there is
the same remarkable silence regarding such widely spread domestic
implements as the saw and the axe. We hear, however, of the pestle
and mortar, of the fire-drill, of the wedge, of the sickle, and of the
shuttle used in weaving. Navigation seems to have been in a very
elementary state. Indeed the art of sailing was but little practised
in Japan even so late as the middle of the 10th century of our era,
subsequent to the general diffusion of Chinese civilization, though
rowing and punting are often mentioned by the early poets. To
what we should call towns or villages very little reference is made
anywhere in the <i>Records</i> or in that part of the <i>Chronicles</i> which contain
the account of the so-called Divine Age. But from what we
learn incidentally it would seem that the scanty population was
chiefly distributed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings along the
coast and up the course of the larger streams. Of house-building
there is frequent mention. Fences were in use. Rugs of skins and
rush-matting were occasionally brought in to sit on, and we even
hear once or twice of silk rugs being used for the same purpose by
the noble and wealthy. The habits of personal cleanliness which so
pleasantly distinguish the modern Japanese from their neighbours,
in continental Asia, though less fully developed than at present
would seem to have existed in the germ in early times, as we read
more than once of bathing in rivers, and are told of bathing women
being specially attached to the person of a certain Imperial infant.
Lustrations, too, formed part of the religious practices of the race.
Latrines are mentioned several times. They would appear to have
been situated away from the houses and to have been generally
placed over a running stream, whence doubtless the name for latrine
in the archaic dialect&mdash;<i>kawaya</i> (river-house). A peculiar sort of
dwelling-place which the two old histories bring prominently under
our notice is the so-called parturition house&mdash;a one-roomed hut
without windows, which a woman was expected to build and retire
into for the purpose Of being delivered unseen. Castles are not
distinctly spoken of until a time which coincides, according to the
received chronology, with the first century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> We then first meet
with the curious term rice-castle, whose precise signification is a
matter of dispute among the native commentators, but which, on
comparison with Chinese descriptions of the early Japanese, should
probably be understood to mean a kind of palisade serving the purpose
of a redoubt, behind which the warriors could ensconce themselves.
The food of the early Japanese consisted of fish and of the
flesh of the wild creatures which fell by the hunter&rsquo;s arrow or were
taken in the trapper&rsquo;s snare. Rice is the only cereal of which there
is such mention made as to place it beyond a doubt that its cultivation
dates back to time immemorial. Beans, millet and barley are
indeed named once, together with silkworms, in the account of the
Divine Age. But the passage has every aspect of an interpolation
in the legend, perhaps not dating back long before the time of the
eighth-century compiler. A few unimportant vegetables and fruits,
of most of which there is but a single mention, are found. The
intoxicating liquor called <i>sake</i> was known in Japan during the mythical
period, and so were chopsticks for eating food with. Cooking
pots and cups and dishes&mdash;the latter both of earthenware and of
leaves of trees&mdash;are also mentioned; but of the use of fire for warming
purposes we hear nothing. Tables are named several times, but
never in connexion with food: they would seem to have been used
exclusively for the purpose of presenting offerings on, and were
probably quite small and low&mdash;in fact, rather trays than tables,
according to European ideas. In the use of clothing and the
specialization of garments the early Japanese had reached a high
level. We read in the most ancient legends of upper garments,
skirts, trowsers, girdles, veils and hats, while both sexes adorned
themselves with necklaces, bracelets and head ornaments of stones
considered precious&mdash;in this respect offering a striking contrast to
their descendants in modern times, of whose attire jewelry forms
no part. The material of their clothes was hempen cloth and
paper&mdash;mulberry bark, coloured by being rubbed with madder, and probably
with woad and other tinctorial plants. All the garments, so
far as we may judge, were woven, sewing being nowhere mentioned.
From the great place which the chase occupied in daily life, we are
led to suppose that skins also were used to make garments of. There
is in the <i>Records</i> at least one passage which favours this supposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
and the <i>Chronicles</i> in one place mention the straw rain-coat and
broad-brimmed hat, which still form the Japanese peasant&rsquo;s effectual
protection against the inclemencies of the weather. The tendrils
of creeping plants served the purposes of strings, and bound the
warrior&rsquo;s sword round his waist. Combs are mentioned, and it is
evident that much attention was devoted to the dressing of the hair.
The men seem to have bound up their hair in two bunches, one on
each side of the head, while the young boys tied theirs in a top-knot,
the unmarried girls let their locks hang down over their necks, and
the married women dressed theirs after a fashion which apparently
combined the two last-named methods. There is no mention in
any of the old books of cutting the hair or beard except in token of
disgrace; neither do we gather that the sexes, but for the matter of
the head-dress, were distinguished by a diversity of apparel and
ornamentation. With regard to the precious stones mentioned
above as having been used as ornaments for the head, neck and arms,
we know from the specimens which have rewarded the labours of
archaeological research in Japan that agate, crystal, glass, jade,
serpentine and steatite were the most used materials, and carved
and pierced cylindrical shapes the commonest forms. The horse&mdash;which
was ridden, but not driven&mdash;the barn-door fowl and the cormorant
used for fishing, are the only domesticated creatures mentioned
in the earlier traditions, with the doubtful exception of the
silkworm. In the later portions of the <i>Records</i> and <i>Chronicles</i>
dogs and cattle are alluded to, but sheep, swine and even cats were
apparently not yet introduced.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>As the prehistoric era draws to its end the above analyses of
Japanese civilization have to be modified. Thus, towards the
close of the 3rd century, ship-building made great progress, and
instead of the small boats hitherto in use, a vessel 100 ft. long
was constructed. Notable above all is the fact that Japan&rsquo;s
turbulent relations with Korea were replaced by friendly intercourse,
so that she began to receive from her neighbour instruction
in the art of writing. The date assigned by the <i>Chronicles</i>
for this important event is <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 285, but it has been proved
almost conclusively that Japanese annals relating to this period
are in error to the extent of 120 years. Hence the introduction
of calligraphy must be placed in 405. Chinese history shows
that between 57 and 247 Japan sent four embassies to the courts
of the Han and the Wei, and this intercourse cannot have failed
to disclose the ideograph. But the knowledge appears to have
been confined to a few interpreters, and not until the year 405
were steps taken to extend it, with the aid of a learned Korean,
Wang-in. Korea herself began to study Chinese learning only
a few years before she undertook to impart it to Japan. We now
find a numerous colony of Koreans passing to Japan and settling
there; a large number are also carried over as prisoners of war,
and the Japanese obtain seamstresses from both of their continental
neighbours. One fact, related with much precision,
shows that the refinements of life were in an advanced condition:
an ice-house is described, and we read that from 374 (? 494) it
became the fashion to store ice in this manner for use in the hot
months by placing it in water or <i>sake</i>. The emperor, Nintoku,
to whose time this innovation is attributed, is one of the romantic
figures of Japanese history. He commenced his career by refusing
to accept the sovereignty from his younger brother, who
pressed him earnestly to do so on the ground that the proper
order of succession had been disturbed by their father&rsquo;s partiality&mdash;though
the rights attaching to primogeniture did not
receive imperative recognition in early Japan. After three
years of this mutual self-effacement, during which the throne
remained vacant, the younger brother committed suicide, and
Nintoku reluctantly became sovereign. He chose Naniwa (the
modern Osaka) for his capital, but he would not take the farmers
from their work to finish the building of a palace, and subsequently,
inferring from the absence of smoke over the houses of
the people that the country was impoverished, he remitted all
taxes and suspended forced labour for a term of three years, during
which his palace fell into a state of ruin and he himself fared in
the coarsest manner. Digging canals, damming rivers, constructing
roads and bridges, and establishing granaries occupied his
attention when love did not distract it. But in affairs of the
heart he was most unhappy. He figures as the sole wearer of
the Japanese crown who was defied by his consort; for when he
took a concubine in despite of the empress, her jealousy was so
bitter that, refusing to be placated by any of his majesty&rsquo;s
verses or other overtures, she left the palace altogether; and
when he sought to introduce another beauty into the inner
chamber, his own half-brother, who carried his proposals, won
the girl for himself. One other fact deserves to be remembered
in connexion with Nintoku&rsquo;s reign: Ki-no-tsuno, representative
of a great family which had filled the highest administrative
and military posts under several sovereigns, is mentioned as
&ldquo;the first to commit to writing in detail the productions of the
soil in each locality.&rdquo; This was in 353 (probably 473). We
shall err little if we date the commencement of Japanese written
annals from this time, though no compilation earlier than the
<i>Kojiki</i> has survived.</p>

<p><i>Early Historical Period.</i>&mdash;With the emperor Rich&#363;, who came
to the throne <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400, the historical period may be said to
commence; for though the chronology of the records is still
questionable, the facts are generally accepted as credible.
Conspicuous loyalty towards the sovereign was not an attribute
of the Japanese Imperial family in early times. Attempts
to usurp the throne were not uncommon, though there are very
few instances of such essays on the part of a subject. Love or
lust played no insignificant part in the drama, and a common
method of placating an irate sovereign was to present a beautiful
damsel for his delectation. The veto of consanguinity did not
receive very strict respect in these matters. Children of the
same father might intermarry, but not those of the same mother;
a canon which becomes explicable on observing that as wives
usually lived apart from their husbands and had the sole custody
of their offspring, two or more families often remained to
the end unconscious of the fact that they had a common sire.
There was a remarkable tendency to organize the nation into
groups of persons following the same pursuit or charged with
the same functions. A group thus composed was called <i>be</i>.
The heads of the great families had titles&mdash;as <i>omi</i>, <i>muraji</i>,
<i>miakko</i>, <i>wake</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;and affairs of state were administered
by the most renowned of these nobles, wholly subject to the
sovereign&rsquo;s ultimate will. The provincial districts were ruled
by scions of the Imperial family, who appear to have been, on
the whole, entirely subservient to the Throne. There were no
tribunals of justice: the ordeal of boiling water or heated metal
was the sole test of guilt or innocence, apart, of course, from
confession, which was often exacted under menace of torture.
A celebrated instance of the ordeal of boiling water is recorded
in 415, when this device was employed to correct the genealogies
of families suspected of falsely claiming descent from emperors
or divine beings. The test proved efficacious, for men conscious
of forgery refused to undergo the ordeal. Deprivation of rank
was the lightest form of punishment; death the commonest,
and occasionally the whole family of an offender became serfs
of the house against which the offence had been committed or
which had been instrumental in disclosing a crime. There are,
however, frequent examples of wrong-doing expiated by the
voluntary surrender of lands or other property. We find several
instances of that extreme type of loyalty which became habitual
in later ages&mdash;suicide in preference to surviving a deceased lord.
On the whole the successive sovereigns of these early times
appear to have ruled with clemency and consideration for the
people&rsquo;s welfare. But there were two notable exceptions&mdash;Yuriaku
(457-479) and Muretsu (499-506). The former slew
men ruthlessly in fits of passion or resentment, and the latter
was the Nero of Japanese history, a man who loved to witness
the agony of his fellows and knew no sentiment of mercy or
remorse. Yet even Yuriaku did not fail to promote industrial
pursuits. Skilled artisans were obtained from Korea, and it is
related that, in 462, this monarch induced the empress and the
ladies of the palace to plant mulberry trees with their own hands
in order to encourage sericulture. Throughout the 5th and 6th
centuries many instances are recorded of the acquisition of
landed estates by the Throne, and their occasional bestowal
upon princes or Imperial consorts, such gifts being frequently
accompanied by the assignment of bodies of agriculturists who
seem to have accepted the position of serfs. Meanwhile Chinese
civilization was gradually becoming known, either by direct
contact or through Korea. Several immigrations of Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
or Korean settlers are on record. No less than 7053 householders
of Chinese subjects came, through Korea, in 540, and one of
their number received high rank together with the post of director
of the Imperial treasury. From these facts, and from a national
register showing the derivation of all the principal families
in Japan, it is clearly established that a considerable strain of
Chinese and Korean blood runs in the veins of many Japanese
subjects.</p>

<p>The most signal and far-reaching event of this epoch was the
importation of the Buddhist creed, which took place in 552.
A Korean monarch acted as propagandist, sending a
special envoy with a bronze image of the Buddha and
<span class="sidenote">Introduction of Buddhism.</span>
with several volumes of the Sutras. Unfortunately
the coming of the foreign faith happened to synchronize with an
epidemic of plague, and conservatives at the Imperial court were
easily able to attribute this visitation to resentment on the part
of the ancestral deities against the invasion of Japan by an alien
creed. Thus the spread of Buddhism was checked; but only for
a time. Thirty-five years after the coming of the Sutras, the
first temple was erected to enshrine a wooden image of the Buddha
16 ft. high. It has often been alleged that the question between
the imported and the indigenous cults had to be decided by the
sword. The statement is misleading. That the final adoption
of Buddhism resulted from a war is true, but its adoption or
rejection did not constitute the motive of the combat. A contest
for the succession to the throne at the opening of Sujun&rsquo;s
reign (588-592) found the partisans of the Indian faith ranged
on one side, its opponents on the other, and in a moment of
stress the leaders of the former, Soma and Prince Umayado,
vowed to erect Buddhist temples should victory rest on their
arms. From that time the future of Buddhism was assured.
In 588 Korea sent Buddhist relics, Buddhist priests, Buddhist
ascetics, architects of Buddhist temples, and casters of Buddhist
images. She had already sent men learned in divination, in
medicine, and in the calendar. The building of temples began
to be fashionable in the closing years of the 6th century, as did
also abdication of the world by people of both sexes; and a
census taken in 623, during the reign of the empress Suiko
(583-628), showed that there were then 46 temples, 816 priests
and 569 nuns in the empire. This rapid growth of the alien
faith was due mainly to two causes: first, that the empress
Suiko, being of the Soga family, naturally favoured a creed
which had found its earliest Japanese patron in the great statesman
and general, Soga no Umako; secondly, that one of the most
illustrious scholars and philosophers ever possessed by Japan,
Prince Sh&#333;toku, devoted all his energies to fostering Buddhism.</p>

<p>The adoption of Buddhism meant to the Japanese much more
than the acquisition of a practical religion with a code of clearly
defined morality in place of the amorphous and jejune cult of
Shint&#333;. It meant the introduction of Chinese civilization.
Priests and scholars crossed in numbers from China, and men
passed over from Japan to study the Sutras at what was then
regarded as the fountain-head of Buddhism. There was also
a constant stream of immigrants from China and Korea, and the
result may be gathered from the fact that a census taken of the
Japanese nobility in 814 indicated 382 Korean and Chinese
families against only 796 of pure Japanese origin. The records
show that in costume and customs a signal advance was made
towards refinement. Hair-ornaments of gold or silver chiselled
in the form of flowers; caps of sarcenet in twelve special tints,
each indicating a different grade; garments of brocade and
embroidery with figured thin silks of various colours&mdash;all these
were worn on ceremonial occasions; the art of painting was
introduced; a recorder&rsquo;s office was established; perfumes were
largely employed; court picnics to gather medicinal herbs were
instituted, princes and princesses attending in brilliant raiment;
Chinese music and dancing were introduced; cross bows and
catapults were added to the weapons of war; domestic architecture
made signal strides in obedience to the examples of Buddhist
sacred edifices, which, from the first, showed magnificence of
dimension and decoration hitherto unconceived in Japan; the
arts of metal-casting and sculpture underwent great improvement;
Prince Sh&#333;toku compiled a code, commonly spoken of as
the first written laws of Japan, but in reality a collection of
maxims evincing a moral spirit of the highest type. In some
respects, however, there was no improvement. The succession
to the throne still tended to provoke disputes among the Imperial
princes; the sword constituted the principal weapon of punishment,
and torture the chief judicial device. Now, too, for the
first time, a noble family is found seeking to usurp the Imperial
authority. The head of the Soga house, Umako, having compassed
the murder of the emperor Sujun and placed on the throne
his own niece (Suiko), swept away all opposition to the latter&rsquo;s
successor, Jomei, and controlled the administration of state
affairs throughout two reigns. In all this he was strongly
seconded by his son, Iruka, who even surpassed him in contumelious
assumption of power and parade of dignity. Iruka was
slain in the presence of the empress K&#333;gyoku by Prince Naka
with the assistance of the minister of the interior, Kamako, and
it is not surprising to find the empress (K&#333;gyoku) abdicating
immediately afterwards in favour of Kamako&rsquo;s protégé, Prince
Karu, who is known in history as K&#333;toku. This Kamako,
planner and leader of the conspiracy which overthrew the Soga,
is remembered by posterity under the name of Kamatari and
as the founder of the most illustrious of Japan&rsquo;s noble houses,
the Fujiwara. At this time (645), a habit which afterwards
contributed materially to the effacement of the Throne&rsquo;s practical
authority was inaugurated. Prince Furubito, pressed by his
brother, Prince Karu, to assume the sceptre in accordance with
his right of primogeniture, made his refusal peremptory by abandoning
the world and taking the tonsure. This retirement to a
monastery was afterwards dictated to several sovereigns by
ministers who found that an active occupant of the throne
impeded their own exercise of administrative autocracy. Furubito&rsquo;s
recourse to the tonsure proved, however, to be merely a
cloak for ambitious designs. Before a year had passed he conspired
to usurp the throne and was put to death with his children,
his consorts strangling themselves. Suicide to escape the
disgrace of defeat had now become a common practice. Another
prominent feature of this epoch was the prevalence of superstition.
The smallest incidents&mdash;the growing of two lotus flowers
on one stem; a popular ballad; the reputed song of a sleeping
monkey; the condition of the water in a pond; rain without
clouds&mdash;all these and cognate trifles were regarded as omens;
wizards and witches deluded the common people; a strange form
of caterpillar was worshipped as the god of the everlasting
world, and the peasants impoverished themselves by making
sacrifices to it.</p>

<p>An interesting epoch is now reached, the first legislative era
of early Japanese history. It commenced with the reign of the
emperor K&#333;toku (645), of whom the <i>Chronicles</i> say
that he &ldquo;honoured the religion of Buddha and despised
<span class="sidenote">First Legislative Epoch.</span>
Shint&#333;&rdquo;; that &ldquo;he was of gentle disposition;
loved men of learning; made no distinction of noble and mean,
and continually dispensed beneficent edicts.&rdquo; The customs
calling most loudly for reform in his time were abuse of the
system of forced labour; corrupt administration of justice;
spoliation of the peasant class; assumption of spurious titles to
justify oppression; indiscriminate distribution of the families
of slaves and serfs; diversion of taxes to the pockets of collectors;
formation of great estates, and a general lack of administrative
centralization. The first step of reform consisted in ordering
the governors of provinces to prepare registers showing the
numbers of freemen and serfs within their jurisdiction as well as
the area of cultivated land. It was further ordained that the
advantages of irrigation should be shared equally with the common
people; that no local governor might try and decide criminal
cases while in his province; that any one convicted of accepting
bribes should be liable to a fine of double the amount as well as
to other punishment; that in the Imperial court a box should
be placed for receiving petitions and a bell hung to be sounded in
the event of delay in answering them or unfairness in dealing
with them; that all absorption of land into great estates should
cease; that barriers, outposts, guards and post-horses should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
provided; that high officials should be dowered with hereditary
estates by way of emolument, the largest of such grants being
3000 homesteads; that men of unblemished character and
proved capacity should be appointed aldermen for adjudicating
criminal matters; that there should be chosen as clerks for governors
and vice-governors of provinces men of solid competence
&ldquo;skilled in writing and arithmetic&rdquo;; that the land should be
parcelled out in fixed proportions to every adult unit of the population
with right of tenure for a term of six years; that forced
labour should be commuted for taxes of silk and cloth; and that
for fiscal and administrative purposes households should be
organized in groups of five, each group under an elder, and ten
groups forming a township, which, again, should be governed
by an elder. Incidentally to these reforms many of the evil
customs of the time are exposed. Thus provincial governors
when they visited the capital were accustomed to travel with
great retinues who appear to have constituted a charge on the
regions through which they passed. The law now limited the
number of a chief governor&rsquo;s attendants to nine, and forbade
him to use official houses or to fare at public cost unless journeying
on public business. Again, men who had acquired some local
distinction, though they did not belong to noble families, took
advantage of the absence of historical records or official registers,
and, representing themselves as descendants of magnates to
whom the charge of public granaries had been entrusted, succeeded
in usurping valuable privileges. The office of provincial
governor had in many cases become hereditary, and not only
were governors largely independent of Imperial control, but also,
since every free man carried arms, there had grown up about
these officials a population relying largely on the law of force.
K&#333;toku&rsquo;s reforms sought to institute a system of temporary
governors, and directed that all arms and armour should be
stored in arsenals built in waste places, except in the case of
provinces adjoining lands where unsubdued aborigines (Yemishi)
dwelt. Punishments were drastic, and in the case of a man convicted
of treason, all his children were executed with him, his
wives and consorts committing suicide. From a much earlier
age suicide had been freely resorted to as the most honourable
exit from pending disgrace, but as yet the samurai&rsquo;s method of
disembowelment was not employed, strangulation or cutting
the throat being the regular practice. Torture was freely
employed and men often died under it. Signal abuses prevailed
in regions beyond the immediate range of the central government&rsquo;s
observation. It has been shown that from early days
the numerous scions of the Imperial family had generally been
provided for by grants of provincial estates. Gradually the
descendants of these men, and the representatives of great
families who held hereditary rank, extended their domains
unscrupulously, employing forced labour to reclaim lands,
which they let to the peasants, not hesitating to appropriate
large slices of public property, and remitting to the central
treasury only such fractions of the taxes as they found convenient.
So prevalent had the exaction of forced labour become
that country-folk, repairing to the capital to seek redress of
grievances, were often compelled to remain there for the purpose
of carrying out some work in which dignitaries of state were
interested. The removal of the capital to a new site on each
change of sovereign involved a vast quantity of unproductive
toil. It is recorded that in 656, when the empress Saimei occupied
the throne, a canal was dug which required the work of
30,000 men and a wall was built which had employed 70,000 men
before its completion. The construction of tombs for grandees
was another heavy drain on the people&rsquo;s labour. Some of these
sepulchres attained enormous dimensions&mdash;that of the emperor
Ojin (270-310) measures 2312 yds. round the outer moat and
is some 60 ft. high; the emperor Nintoku&rsquo;s (313-399) is still
larger, and there is a tumulus in Kawachi on the flank of which a
good-sized village has been built. K&#333;toku&rsquo;s laws provided that
the tomb of a prince should not be so large as to require the work
of more than 1000 men for seven days, and that the grave of a
petty official must be completed by 50 men in one day. Moreover,
it was forbidden to bury with the body gold, silver,
copper, iron, jewelled shirts, jade armour or silk brocade. It
appears that the custom of suicide or sacrifice at the tomb of
grandees still survived, and that people sometimes cut off their
hair or stabbed their thighs preparatory to declaiming a threnody.
All these practices were vetoed. Abuses had grown up even in
connexion with the Shint&#333; rite of purgation. This rite required
not only the reading of rituals but also the offering of food and
fruits. For the sake of these edibles the rite was often harshly
enforced, especially in connexion with pollution from contact
with corpses; and thus it fell out that when of two brothers,
returning from a scene of forced labour, one lay down upon the
road and died, the other, dreading the cost of compulsory purgation,
refused to take up the body. Many other evil customs
came into existence in connexion with this rite, and all were
dealt with in the new laws. Not the least important of the
reforms then introduced was the organization of the ministry
after the model of the Tang dynasty of China. Eight departments
of state were created, and several of them received names
which are similarly used to this day. Not only the institutions
of China were borrowed but also her official costumes. During
K&#333;toku&rsquo;s reign 19 grades of head-gear were instituted, and in
the time of Tenchi (668-671) the number was increased to 26,
with corresponding robes. Throughout this era intercourse was
frequent with China, and the spread of Buddhism continued
steadily. The empress Saimei (655-661), who succeeded K&#333;toku,
was an earnest patron of the faith. By her command several
public expositions of the Sutras were given, and the building of
temples went on in many districts, estates being liberally granted
for the maintenance of these places of worship.</p>

<p><i>The Fujiwara Era.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Chronicles of Japan</i> the year
672 is treated as a kind of interregnum. It was in truth a
year of something like anarchy, a great part of it being occupied
by a conflict of unparalleled magnitude between Prince &#332;tomo
(called in history Emperor K&#333;bun) and Prince &#332;ama, who
emerged victorious and is historically entitled Temmu (673-686).
The four centuries that followed are conveniently designated
the Fujiwara era, because throughout that long interval affairs
of state were controlled by the Fujiwara family, whose daughters
were given as consorts to successive sovereigns and whose sons
filled all the high administrative posts. It has been related
above that Kamako, chief of the Shint&#333; officials, inspired the
assassination of the Soga chief, Iruka, and thus defeated the
latter&rsquo;s designs upon the throne in the days of the empress
K&#333;gyoku. Kamako, better known to subsequent generations
as Kamatari, was thenceforth regarded with unlimited favour by
successive sovereigns, and just before his death in 670, the
family name of Fujiwara was bestowed on him by the emperor
Tenchi. Kamatari himself deserved all the honour he received,
but his descendants abused the high trust reposed in them,
reduced the sovereign to a mere puppet, and exercised Imperial
authority without openly usurping it. Much of this was due to
the adoption of Chinese administrative systems, a process which
may be said to have commenced during the reign of K&#333;toku
(645-654) and to have continued almost uninterruptedly until the
11th century. Under these systems the emperor ceased directly
to exercise supreme civil or military power: he became merely
the source of authority, not its wielder, the civil functions being
delegated to a bureaucracy and the military to a soldier class.
Possibly had the custom held of transferring the capital to a new
site on each change of sovereign, and had the growth of luxurious
habits been thus checked, the comparatively simple life of
early times might have held the throne and the people in closer
contact. But from the beginning of the 8th century a strong
tendency to avoid these costly migrations developed itself. In
709 the court took up its residence at Nara, remaining there until
784; ten years after the latter date Ki&#333;to became the permanent
metropolis. The capital at Nara&mdash;established during the reign
of the empress Gemmy&#333; (708-715)&mdash;was built on the plan of the
Chinese metropolis. It had nine gates and nine avenues, the
palace being situated in the northern section and approached by
a broad, straight avenue, which divided the city into two perfectly
equal halves, all the other streets running parallel to this main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
avenue or at right angles to it. Seven sovereigns reigned at
Heij&#333; (castle of peace), as Nara is historically called, and,
during this period of 75 years, seven of the grandest temples
ever seen in Japan were erected; a multitude of idols were cast,
among them a colossal bronze Daibutsu 53½ ft. high; large
temple-bells were founded, and all the best artists and artisans
of the era devoted their services to these works. This religious
mania reached its acme in the reign of the emperor Sh&#333;mu (724-748),
a man equally superstitious and addicted to display. In
Temmu&rsquo;s time the custom had been introduced of compelling
large numbers of persons to enter the Buddhist priesthood with
the object of propitiating heaven&rsquo;s aid to heal the illness of an
illustrious personage. In Sh&#333;mu&rsquo;s day every natural calamity
or abnormal phenomenon was regarded as calling for religious
services on a large scale, and the great expense involved in all
these buildings and ceremonials, supplemented by lavish outlays
on court pageants, was severely felt by the nation. The condition
of the agricultural class, who were the chief tax-payers,
was further aggravated by the operation of the emperor K&#333;toku&rsquo;s
land system, which rendered tenure so uncertain as to deter
improvements. Therefore, in the Nara epoch, the principle of
private ownership of land began to be recognized. Attention
was also paid to road-making, bridge-building, river control and
house construction, a special feature of this last being the use
of tiles for roofing purposes in place of the shingles or thatch
hitherto employed. In all these steps of progress Buddhist
priests took an active part. Costumes were now governed by
purely Chinese fashions. This change had been gradually introduced
from the time of K&#333;toku&rsquo;s legislative measures&mdash;generally
called the Taikwa reforms after the name of the era (645-650) of
their adoption&mdash;and was rendered more thorough by supplementary
enactments in the period 701-703 while Mommu occupied
the throne. Ladies seem by this time to have abandoned the
strings of beads worn in early eras round the neck, wrists and
ankles. They used ornaments of gold, silver or jade in their
hair, but in other respects their habiliments closely resembled
those of men, and to make the difference still less conspicuous
they straddled their horses when riding. Attempts were made
to facilitate travel by establishing stores of grain along the
principal highways, but as yet there were no hostelries, and if
a wayfarer did not find shelter in the house of a friend, he had to
bivouac as best he could. Such a state of affairs in the provinces
offered a marked contrast to the luxurious indulgence which had
now begun to prevail in the capital. There festivals of various
kinds, dancing, verse-composing, flower picnics, archery, polo,
football&mdash;of a very refined nature&mdash;hawking, hunting and gambling
absorbed the attention of the aristocracy. Nothing disturbed
the serenity of the epoch except a revolt of the northern
Yemishi, which was temporarily subdued by a Fujiwara general,
for the Fujiwara had not yet laid aside the martial habits of
their ancestors. In 794 the Imperial capital was transferred
from Nara to Ki&#333;to by order of the emperor Kwammu, one of
the greatest of Japanese sovereigns. Education, the organization
of the civil service, riparian works, irrigation improvements,
the separation of religion from politics, the abolition of sinecure
offices, devices for encouraging and assisting agriculture, all
received attention from him. But a twenty-two years&rsquo; campaign
against the northern Yemishi; the building of numerous temples;
the indulgence of such a passionate love of the chase that he
organized 140 hunting excursions during his reign of 25 years;
profuse extravagance on the part of the aristocracy in Ki&#333;to
and the exactions of provincial nobles, conspired to sink the
working classes into greater depths of hardship than ever.
Farmers had to borrow money and seed-rice from local officials
or Buddhist temples, hypothecating their land as security; thus
the temples and the nobles extended their already great estates,
whilst the agricultural population gradually fell into a position
of practical serfdom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Fujiwara family were steadily developing their
influence in Ki&#333;to. Their methods were simple but
thoroughly effective. &ldquo;By progressive exercises of
arbitrariness they gradually contrived that the choice of a
<span class="sidenote">Rise of the Fujiwara.</span>
consort for the sovereign should be legally limited to
a daughter of their family, five branches of which were
specially designated to that honour through all ages. When a
son was born to an emperor, the Fujiwara took the child into
one of their palaces, and on his accession to the throne, the
particular Fujiwara noble that happened to be his maternal
grandfather became regent of the empire. This office of regent,
created towards the close of the 9th century, was part of the
scheme; for the Fujiwara did not allow the purple to be worn by
a sovereign after he had attained his majority, or, if they suffered
him to wield the sceptre during a few years of manhood, they
compelled him to abdicate so soon as any independent aspirations
began to impair his docility; and since for the purposes of
administration in these constantly recurring minorities an office
more powerful than that of prime minister (daj&#333; daijin) was
needed, they created that of regent (kwambaku), making it
hereditary in their own family. In fact the history of Japan
from the 9th to the 19th century may be described as the history
of four families, the Fujiwara, the Taira, the Minamoto and the
Tokugawa. The Fujiwara governed through the emperor; the
Taira, the Minamoto and the Tokugawa governed in spite of the
emperor. The Fujiwara based their power on matrimonial alliances
with the Throne; the Taira, the Minamoto and the Tokugawa
based theirs on the possession of armed strength which the throne
had no competence to control. There another broad line of cleavage
is seen. Throughout the Fujiwara era the centre of political
gravity remained always in the court. Throughout the era of
the Taira, the Minamoto and the Tokugawa the centre of political
gravity was transferred to a point outside the court, the headquarters
of a military feudalism.&rdquo; The process of transfer was
of course gradual. It commenced with the granting of large
tracts of tax-free lands to noblemen who had wrested them from
the aborigines (Yemishi) or had reclaimed them by means of serf-labour.
These tracts lay for the most part in the northern and
eastern parts of the main island, at such a distance from the
Capital that the writ of the central government did not run there;
and since such lands could be rented at rates considerably less
than the tax levied on farms belonging to the state, the peasants
by degrees abandoned the latter and settled on the former,
with the result that the revenues of the Throne steadily diminished,
while those of the provincial magnates correspondingly
increased. Moreover, in the 7th century, at the time of the
adoption of Chinese models of administration and organization,
the court began to rely for military protection on the services of
guards temporarily drafted from the provincial troops, and,
during the protracted struggle against the Yemishi in the north
and east in the 8th century, the fact that the power of the sword
lay with the provinces began to be noted.</p>

<p>Ki&#333;to remained the source of authority. But with the growth
of luxury and effeminacy in the capital the Fujiwara became
more and more averse from the hardships of campaigning,
and in the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively,
<span class="sidenote">The Taira and the Minamoto.</span>
the Taira and the Minamoto<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> families came into prominence
as military leaders, the field of the Taira operations being
the south and west, that of the Minamoto the north and east.
Had the court reserved to itself and munificently exercised the
privilege of rewarding these services, it might still have retained
power and wealth. But by a niggardly and contemptuous policy
on the part of Ki&#333;to not only were the Minamoto leaders estranged
but also they assumed the right of recompensing their followers
with tax-free estates, an example which the Taira leaders quickly
followed. By the early years of the 12th century these estates
had attracted the great majority of the farming class, whereas the
public land was left wild and uncultivated. In a word, the court
and the Fujiwara found themselves without revenue, while the
coffers of the Taira and the Minamoto were full: the power of
the purse and the power of the sword had passed effectually to the
two military families. Prominent features of the moral condition
of the capital at this era (12th century) were superstition, refinement
and effeminacy. A belief was widely held that calamity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
could not be averted or success insured without recourse to
Buddhist priests. Thus, during a reign of only 13 years at the
close of the 11th century, the emperor Shirakawa caused 5420
religious pictures to be painted, ordered the casting of 127 statues
of Buddha, each 11 ft. high, of 3150 life-sized images and of
2930 smaller idols, and constructed 21 large temples as well as
446,630 religious edifices of various kinds. Side by side with this
faith in the supernatural, sexual immorality prevailed widely,
never accompanied, however, by immodesty. Literary proficiency
ranked as the be-all and end-all of existence. &ldquo;A man
estimated the conjugal qualities of a young lady by her skill
in finding scholarly similes and by her perception of the
cadence of words. If a woman was so fortunate as to acquire a
reputation for learning, she possessed a certificate of universal
virtue and amiability.&rdquo; All the pastimes of the Nara epoch
were pursued with increased fervour and elaboration in the Heian
(Ki&#333;to) era. The building of fine dwelling-houses and the laying
out of landscape gardens took place on a considerable scale,
though in these respects the ideals of later ages were not yet
reached. As to costume, the close-fitting, business-like and
comparatively simple dress of the 8th century was exchanged
for a much more elaborate style. During the Nara epoch the
many-hued hats of China had been abandoned for a sober head-gear
of silk gauze covered with black lacquer, but in the Heian
era this was replaced by an imposing structure glistening with
jewels: the sleeves of the tunic grew so long that they hung to the
knees when a man&rsquo;s arms were crossed, and the trowsers were
made so full and baggy that they resembled a divided skirt.
From this era may be said to have commenced the manufacture
of the tasteful and gorgeous textile fabrics for which Japan afterwards
became famous. &ldquo;A fop&rsquo;s ideal was to wear several suits,
one above the other, disposing them so that their various colours
showed in harmoniously contrasting lines at the folds on the
bosom and at the edges of the long sleeves. A successful costume
created a sensation in court circles. Its wearer became the hero
of the hour, and under the pernicious influence of such ambition
men began even to powder their faces and rouge their cheeks like
women. As for the fair sex, their costume reached the acme of
unpracticality and extravagance in this epoch. Long flowing
hair was essential, and what with developing the volume and
multiplying the number of her robes, and wearing above her
trowsers a many-plied train, a grand lady of the time always
seemed to be struggling to emerge from a cataract of habiliments.&rdquo;
It was fortunate for Japan that circumstances favoured the
growth of a military class in this age of her career, for had the
conditions existing in Ki&#333;to during the Heian epoch spread
throughout the whole country, the penalty never escaped by a
demoralized nation must have overtaken her. But by the
middle of the 12th century the pernicious influence of the Fujiwara
had paled before that of the Taira and the Minamoto, and
a question of succession to the throne marshalled the latter two
families in opposite camps, thus inaugurating an era of civil war
which held the country in the throes of almost continuous battle
for 450 years, placed it under the administration of a military
feudalism, and educated a nation of warriors. At first the Minamoto
were vanquished and driven from the capital, Kiyomori,
the Taira chief, being left complete master of the situation. He
established his headquarters at Rokuharu, in Ki&#333;to, appropriated
the revenues of 30 out of the 66 provinces forming the empire,
and filled all the high offices of state with his own relatives
or connexions. But he made no radical change in the administrative
system, preferring to follow the example of the Fujiwara
by keeping the throne in the hands of minors. And he committed
the blunder of sparing the lives of two youthful sons of
his defeated rival, the Minamoto chief. They were Yoritomo
and Yoshitsun&#275;; the latter the greatest strategist Japan ever produced,
with perhaps one exception; the former, one of her three
greatest statesmen, the founder of military feudalism. By these
two men the Taira were so completely overthrown that they
never raised their heads again, a sea-fight at Dan-no-ura (1155)
giving them the <i>coup de grâce</i>. Their supremacy had lasted
22 years.</p>

<p><i>The Feudal Era.</i>&mdash;Yoritomo, acting largely under the advice
of an astute counsellor, Oye no Hiromoto, established his seat
of power at Kamakura, 300 m. from Ki&#333;to. He saw that,
effectively to utilize the strength of the military class, propinquity
to the military centres in the provinces was essential. At
Kamakura he organized an administrative body similar in mechanism
to that of the metropolitan government but studiously differentiated
in the matter of nomenclature. As to the country
at large, he brought it effectually under the sway of Kamakura
by placing the provinces under the direct control of military
governors, chosen and appointed by himself. No attempt was
made, however, to interfere in any way with the polity in Ki&#333;to:
it was left intact, and the nobles about the Throne&mdash;<i>kuge</i> (courtly
houses), as they came to be called in contradistinction to the
<i>buke</i> (military houses)&mdash;were placated by renewal of their
property titles. The Buddhist priests, also, who had been
treated most harshly during the Taira tenure of power, found
their fortunes restored under Kamakura&rsquo;s sway. Subsequently
Yoritomo obtained for himself the title of <i>sei-itai-sh&#333;gun</i>
(barbarian-subduing generalissimo), and just as the office of
regent (kwambaku) had long been hereditary in the Fujiwara
family, so the office of sh&#333;gun became thenceforth hereditary
in that of the Minamoto. These changes were radical. They
signified a complete shifting of the centre of power. During
eighteen centuries from the time of Jimmu&rsquo;s invasion&mdash;as
Japanese historians reckon&mdash;the country had been ruled from
the south; now the north became supreme, and for a civilian
administration a purely military was substituted. But there
was no contumely towards the court in Ki&#333;to. Kamakura made
a show of seeking Imperial sanction for every one of its acts, and
the whole of the military administration was carried on in the
name of the emperor by a sh&#333;gun who called himself the Imperial
deputy. In this respect things changed materially after the
death of Yoritomo (1198). Kamakura then became the scene
of a drama analogous to that acted in Ki&#333;to from the 10th
century.</p>

<p>The H&#333;j&#333; family, to which belonged Masa, Yoritomo&rsquo;s consort,
assumed towards the Kamakura sh&#333;gun an attitude similar to
that previously assumed by the Fujiwara family
towards the emperor in Ki&#333;to. A child, who on
<span class="sidenote">Rule of the H&#333;j&#333;.</span>
state occasions was carried to the council chamber in
Masa&rsquo;s arms, served as the nominal repository of the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s
power, the functions of administration being discharged in reality
by the H&#333;j&#333; family, whose successive heads took the name of
<i>shikken</i> (constable). At first care was taken to have the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s
office filled by a near relative of Yoritomo; but after the death
of that great statesman&rsquo;s two sons and his nephew, the puppet
sh&#333;guns were taken from the ranks of the Fujiwara or of the
Imperial princes, and were deposed so soon as they attempted
to assert themselves. What this meant becomes apparent when
we note that in the interval of 83 years between 1220 and 1308,
there were six sh&#333;guns whose ages at the time of appointment
ranged from 3 to 16. Whether, if events had not forced their
hands, the H&#333;j&#333; constables would have maintained towards the
Throne the reverent demeanour adopted by Yoritomo must
remain a matter of conjecture. What actually happened was
that the ex-emperor, Go-Toba, made an ill-judged attempt
(1221) to break the power of Kamakura. He issued a call to
arms which was responded to by some thousands of cenobites
and as many soldiers of Taira extraction. In the brief struggle
that ensued the Imperial partisans were wholly shattered, and
the direct consequences were the dethronement and exile of the
reigning emperor, the banishment of his predecessor together
with two princes of the blood, and the compulsory adoption of
the tonsure by Go-Toba; while the indirect consequence was that
the succession to the throne and the tenure of Imperial power
fell under the dictation of the H&#333;j&#333; as they had formerly fallen
under the direction of the Fujiwara. Yoshitoki, then head of
the H&#333;j&#333; family, installed his brother, Tokifusa, as military
governor of Ki&#333;to, and confiscating about 3000 estates, the
property of those who had espoused the Imperial cause, distributed
these lands among the adherents of his own family, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
greatly strengthening the basis of the feudal system. &ldquo;It fared
with the H&#333;j&#333; as it had fared with all the great families that
preceded them: their own misrule ultimately wrought their
ruin. Their first eight representatives were talented and upright
administrators. They took justice, simplicity and truth
for guiding principles; they despised luxury and pomp; they
never aspired to high official rank; they were content with two
provinces for estates, and they sternly repelled the effeminate,
depraved customs of Ki&#333;to.&rdquo; Thus the greater part of the 13th
century was, on the whole, a golden era for Japan, and the lower
orders learned to welcome feudalism. Nevertheless no century
furnished more conspicuous illustrations of the peculiarly
Japanese system of vicarious government. Children occupied
the position of sh&#333;gun in Kamakura under authority emanating
from children on the throne in Ki&#333;to; and members of the H&#333;j&#333;
family as shikken administered affairs at the mandate of the
child sh&#333;guns. Through all three stages in the dignities of
mikado, sh&#333;gun and shikken, the strictly regulated principle of
heredity was maintained, according to which no H&#333;j&#333; shikken
could ever become sh&#333;gun; no Minamoto or Fujiwara could
occupy the throne. At the beginning of the 14th century, however,
several causes combined to shake the supremacy of the
H&#333;j&#333;. Under the sway of the ninth shikken (Takatoki), the
austere simplicity of life and earnest discharge of executive duties
which had distinguished the early chiefs of the family were
exchanged for luxury, debauchery and perfunctory government.
Thus the management of fiscal affairs fell into the hands of
Takasuke, a man of usurious instincts. It had been the wise
custom of the H&#333;j&#333; constables to store grain in seasons of plenty,
and distribute it at low prices in times of dearth. There occurred
at this epoch a succession of bad harvests, but instead of opening
the state granaries with benevolent liberality, Takasuke sold
their contents at the highest obtainable rates; and, by way of
contrast to the prevailing indigence, the people saw the constable
in Kamakura affecting the pomp and extravagance of a sovereign
waited upon by 37 mistresses, supporting a band of 2000 dancers,
and keeping a pack of 5000 fighting dogs. The throne happened
to be then occupied (1310-1338) by an emperor, Go-Daigo, who
had reached full maturity before his accession, and was correspondingly
averse from acting the puppet part assigned to
the sovereigns of his time. Female influence contributed to his
impatience. One of his concubines bore a son for whom he
sought to obtain nomination as prince imperial, in defiance of an
arrangement made by the H&#333;j&#333; that the succession should pass
alternately to the senior and junior branches of the Imperial
family. Kamakura refused to entertain Go-Daigo&rsquo;s project,
and thenceforth the child&rsquo;s mother importuned her sovereign
and lover to overthrow the H&#333;j&#333;. The <i>entourage</i> of the throne
in Ki&#333;to at this time was a counterpart of former eras. The
Fujiwara, indeed, wielded nothing of their ancient influence.
They had been divided by the H&#333;j&#333; into five branches, each
endowed with an equal right to the office of regent, and their
strength was thus dissipated in struggling among themselves
for the possession of the prize. But what the Fujiwara had done
in their days of greatness, what the Taira had done during their
brief tenure of power, the Saionji were now doing, namely,
aspiring to furnish prime ministers and empresses from their own
family solely. They had already given consorts to five emperors
in succession, and jealous rivals were watching keenly to attack
this clan which threatened to usurp the place long held by the
most illustrious family in the land. A petty incident disturbed
this state of very tender equilibrium before the plan of the H&#333;j&#333;&rsquo;s
enemies had fully matured, and the emperor presently found
himself an exile on the island of Oki. But there now appeared
upon the scene three men of great prowess: Kusunoki Masashige,
Nitta Yoshisada and Ashikaga Takauji. The first espoused
from the outset the cause of the Throne and, though commanding
only a small force, held the H&#333;j&#333; troops in check. The last two
were both of Minamoto descent. Their common ancestor was
Minamoto Yoshiiye, whose exploits against the northern Yemishi
in the second half of the 11th century had so impressed his
countrymen that they gave him the title of Hachiman Tar&#333; (first-born
of the god of war). Both men took the field originally in
the cause of the H&#333;j&#333;, but at heart they desired to be avenged
upon the latter for disloyalty to the Minamoto. Nitta Yoshisada
marched suddenly against Kamakura, carried it by storm and
committed the city to the flames. Ashikaga Takauji occupied
Ki&#333;to, and with the suicide of Takatoki the H&#333;j&#333; fell finally from
rule after 115 years of supremacy (1219-1334). The emperor
now returned from exile, and his son, Prince Moriyoshi, having
been appointed to the office of sh&#333;gun at Kamakura, the
restoration of the administrative power to the Throne seemed
an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>Go-Daigo, however, was not in any sense a wise sovereign.
The extermination of the H&#333;j&#333; placed wide estates at his disposal,
but instead of rewarding those who had deserved
well of him, he used a great part of them to enrich
<span class="sidenote">The Ashikaga Shoguns.</span>
his favourites, the companions of his dissipation.
Ashikaga Takauji sought just such an opportunity. The following
year (1335) saw him proclaiming himself sh&#333;gun at Kamakura,
and after a complicated pageant of incidents, the emperor
Go-Daigo was obliged once more to fly from Ki&#333;to. He carried
the regalia with him, refused to submit to Takauji, and declined
to recognize his usurped title of sh&#333;gun. The Ashikaga chief
solved the situation by deposing Go-Daigo and placing upon
the throne another scion of the imperial family who is known in
history as K&#333;my&#333; (1336-1348), and who, of course, confirmed
Takauji in the office of sh&#333;gun. Thus commenced the Ashikaga
line of sh&#333;guns, and thus commenced also a fifty-six-year period
of divided sovereignty, the emperor Go-Daigo and his descendants
reigning in Yoshino as the southern court (<i>nanch&#333;</i>), and the
emperor K&#333;my&#333; and his descendants reigning in Ki&#333;to as the
northern court (<i>hokuch&#333;</i>). It was by the efforts of the sh&#333;gun
Yoshimitsu, one of the greatest of the Ashikaga potentates, that
this quarrel was finally composed, but during its progress the
country had fallen into a deplorable condition. &ldquo;The constitutional
powers had become completely disorganized, especially in
regions at a distance from the chief towns. The peasant was
impoverished, his spirit broken, his hope of better things completely
gone. He dreamed away his miserable existence and
left the fields untilled. Bands of robbers followed the armies
through the interior of the country, and increased the feeling of
lawlessness and insecurity. The coast population, especially
that of the island of Ki&#363;shi&#363;, had given itself up in a great
measure to piracy. Even on the shores of Korea and China
these enterprising Japanese corsairs made their appearance.&rdquo;
The sh&#333;gun Yoshimitsu checked piracy, and there ensued
between Japan and China a renewal of cordial intercourse
which, upon the part of the sh&#333;gun, developed phases plainly
suggesting an admission of Chinese suzerainty.</p>

<p>For a brief moment during the sway of Yoshimitsu the country
had rest from internecine war, but immediately after his death
(1394) the struggle began afresh. Many of the great territorial
lords had now grown too puissant to concern themselves about
either mikado or sh&#333;gun. Each fought for his own hand, thinking
only of extending his sway and his territories. By the middle
of the 16th century Ki&#333;to was in ruins, and little vitality remained
in any trade or industry except those that ministered
to the wants of the warrior. Again in the case of the Ashikaga
sh&#333;guns the political tendency to exercise power vicariously
was shown, as it had been shown in the case of the mikados in
Ki&#333;to and in the case of the Minamoto in Kamakura. What
the regents had been to the emperors and the constables to the
Minamoto sh&#333;guns, that the wardens (<i>kwanry&#333;</i>) were to the
Ashikaga sh&#333;guns. Therefore, for possession of this office of
kwanry&#333; vehement conflicts were waged, and at one time five
rival sh&#333;guns were used as figure-heads by contending factions.
Yoshimitsu had apportioned an ample allowance for the support
of the Imperial court, but in the continuous warfare following
his death the estates charged with the duty of paying this
allowance ceased to return any revenue; the court nobles had
to seek shelter and sustenance with one or other of the feudal
chiefs in the provinces, and the court itself was reduced to such a
state of indigence that when the emperor Go-Tsuchi died (1500),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
his corpse lay for forty days awaiting burial, no funds being
available for purposes of sepulture.</p>

<p>Alone among the vicissitudes of these troublous times the
strength and influence of Buddhism grew steadily. The great
monasteries were military strongholds as well as places of worship.
When the emperor Kwammu chose Ki&#333;to for his capital, he
established on the hill of Hiyei-zan, which lay north-east of the
city, a magnificent temple to ward off the evil influences supposed
to emanate from that quarter. Twenty years later, K&#333;b&#333;, the
most famous of all Japanese Buddhist saints, founded on Koyasan
in Yamato a monastery not less important than that of
Hiyei-zan. These and many other temples had large tax-free
estates, and for the protection of their property they found it
expedient to train and arm the cenobites as soldiers. From that
to taking active part in the political struggles of the time was but
a short step, especially as the great temples often became refuges
of sovereigns and princes who, though nominally forsaking the
world, retained all their interest, and even continued to take an
active part, in its vicissitudes. It is recorded of the emperor
Shirakawa (1073-1086) that the three things which he declared
his total inability to control were the waters of the river Kamo,
the fall of the dice, and the monks of Buddha. His successors
might have confessed equal inability. Kiy&#333;mori, the puissant
chief of the Taira family, had fruitlessly essayed to defy the
Buddhists; Yoritomo, in the hour of his most signal triumph,
thought it wise to placate them. Where these representatives
of centralized power found themselves impotent, it may well be
supposed that the comparatively petty <span class="correction" title="amended from chieftans">chieftains</span> who fought
each for his own hand in the 15th and 16th centuries were incapable
of accomplishing anything. In fact, the task of centralizing
the administrative power, and thus restoring peace and
order to the distracted empire, seemed, at the middle of the 16th
century, a task beyond achievement by human capacity.</p>

<p>But if ever events create the men to deal with them, such was
the case in the second half of that century. Three of the
greatest captains and statesmen in Japanese history
appeared upon the stage simultaneously, and moreover
<span class="sidenote">Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu.</span>
worked in union, an event altogether inconsistent
with the nature of the age. They were
Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi (the <i>taik&#333;</i>) and Tokugawa Iyeyasu.
Nobunaga belonged to the Taira family and was originally
ruler of a small fief in the province of Owari. Iyeyasu, a
sub-feudatory of Nobunaga&rsquo;s enemy, the powerful daimy&#333;<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> of
Mikawa and two other provinces, was a scion of the Minamoto
and therefore eligible for the sh&#333;gunate. Hideyoshi was a
peasant&rsquo;s son, equally lacking in patrons and in personal attractions.
No chance seemed more remote than that such men,
above all Hideyoshi, could possibly rise to supreme power. On
the other hand, one outcome of the commotion with which the
country had seethed for more than four centuries was to give
special effect to the principle of natural selection. The fittest
alone surviving, the qualities that made for fitness came to take
precedence of rank or station, and those qualities were prowess
in the battlefield and wisdom in the statesman&rsquo;s closet. &ldquo;Any
plebeian that would prove himself a first-class fighting man was
willingly received into the armed <i>comitatus</i> which every feudal
potentate was eager to attach to himself and his flag.&rdquo; It was
thus that Hideyoshi was originally enrolled in the ranks of
Nobunaga&rsquo;s retainers.</p>

<p>Nobunaga, succeeding to his small fief in Owari in 1542, added
to it six whole provinces within 25 years of continuous endeavour.
Being finally invited by the emperor to undertake the pacification
of the country, and appealed to by Yoshiaki, the last of the
Ashikaga chiefs, to secure for him the sh&#333;gunate, he marched into
Ki&#333;to at the head of a powerful army (1568), and, having accomplished
the latter purpose, was preparing to complete the former
when he fell under the sword of a traitor. Throughout his
brilliant career he had the invaluable assistance of Hideyoshi,
who would have attained immortal fame on any stage in any era.
Hideyoshi entered Nobunaga&rsquo;s service as a groom and ended
by administering the whole empire. When he accompanied
Nobunaga to Ki&#333;to in obedience to the invitation of the mikado,
Okimachi, order and tranquillity were quickly restored in the
capital and its vicinity. But to extend this blessing to the whole
country, four powerful daimy&#333;s as well as the militant monks had
still to be dealt with. The monks had from the outset sheltered
and succoured Nobunaga&rsquo;s enemies, and one great prelate,
Kenry&#333;, hierarch of the Monto sect, whose headquarters were
at Osaka, was believed to aspire to the throne itself. In 1571
Nobunaga attacked and gave to the flames the celebrated
monastery of Hiyei-zan, established nearly eight centuries previously;
and in 1580 he would have similarly served the splendid
temple Hongwan-ji in Osaka, had not the mikado sought and
obtained grace for it. The task then remained of subduing four
powerful daimy&#333;s, three in the south and one in the north-east,
who continued to follow the bent of their own warlike ambitions
without paying the least attention to either sovereign or sh&#333;gun.
The task was commenced by sending an army under Hideyoshi
against M&#333;ri of Ch&#333;sh&#363;, whose fief lay on the northern shore of
the Shimonoseki strait. This proved to be the last enterprise
planned by Nobunaga. On a morning in June 1582 one of the
corps intended to reinforce Hideyoshi&rsquo;s army marched out of
Kameyama under the command of Akechi Mitsuhide, who either
harboured a personal grudge against Nobunaga or was swayed
by blind ambition. Mitsuhide suddenly changed the route of
his troops, led them to Ki&#333;to, and attacked the temple Honn&#333;-ji
where Nobunaga was sojourning all unsuspicious of treachery.
Rescue and resistance being alike hopeless, the great soldier
committed suicide. Thirteen days later, Hideyoshi, having
concluded peace with M&#333;ri of Ch&#333;sh&#363;, fell upon Mitsuhide&rsquo;s
forces and shattered them, Mitsuhide himself being killed by a
peasant as he fled from the field.</p>

<p>Nobunaga&rsquo;s removal at once made Hideyoshi the most conspicuous
figure in the empire, the only man with any claim to
dispute that title being Tokugawa Iyeyasu. These
two had hitherto worked in concert. But the question
<span class="sidenote">Hideyoshi.</span>
of the succession to Nobunaga&rsquo;s estates threw the country
once more into tumult. He left two grown-up sons and a baby
grandson, whose father, Nobunaga&rsquo;s first-born, had perished
in the holocaust at Honn&#333;-ji. Hideyoshi, not unmindful, it may
be assumed, of the privileges of a guardian, espoused the cause
of the infant, and wrested from Nobunaga&rsquo;s three other great
captains a reluctant endorsement of his choice. Nobutaka, third
son of Nobunaga, at once drew the sword, which he presently had
to turn against his own person; two years later (1584), his elder
brother, Nobuo, took the field under the aegis of Tokugawa
Iyeyasu. Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu, now pitted against each other
for the first time, were found to be of equal prowess, and being
too wise to prolong a useless war, they reverted to their old
alliance, subsequently confirming it by a family union, the son
of Iyeyasu being adopted by Hideyoshi and the latter&rsquo;s daughter
being given in marriage to Iyeyasu. Hideyoshi had now been
invested by the mikado with the post of regent, and his position
in the capital was omnipotent. He organized in Ki&#333;to a magnificent
pageant, in which the principal figures were himself,
Iyeyasu, Nobuo and twenty-seven daimy&#333;s. The emperor was
present. Hideyoshi sat on the right of the throne, and all the
nobles did obeisance to the sovereign. Prior to this event
Hideyoshi had conducted against the still defiant daimy&#333;s of
Ki&#363;shi&#363;, especially Shimazu of Satsuma, the greatest army ever
massed by any Japanese general, and had reduced the island
of the nine provinces, not by weight of armament only, but also
by a signal exercise of the wise clemency which distinguished
him from all the statesmen of his era.</p>

<p>The whole of Japan was now under Hideyoshi&rsquo;s sway except
the fiefs in the extreme north and those in the region known as
the Kwant&#333;, namely, the eight provinces forming the eastern
elbow of the main island. Seven of these provinces were virtually
under the sway of H&#333;j&#333; Ujimasa, fourth representative of a
family established in 1476 by a brilliant adventurer of Ise, not
related in any way to the great but then extinct house of Kamakura
H&#333;j&#333;s. The daimy&#333;s in the north were comparatively
powerless to resist Hideyoshi, but to reach them the Kwant&#333; had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
to be reduced, and not only was its chief, Ujimasa, a formidable
foe, but also the topographical features of the district represented
fortifications of immense strength. After various unsuccessful
overtures, having for their purpose to induce Ujimasa to visit
the capital and pay homage to the emperor, Hideyoshi marched
from Ki&#333;to in the spring of 1590 at the head of 170,000 men, his
colleagues Nobuo and Iyeyasu having under their orders 80,000
more. The campaign ended as did all Hideyoshi&rsquo;s enterprises,
except that he treated his vanquished enemies with unusual
severity. During the three months spent investing Odawara,
the northern daimy&#333;s surrendered, and thus the autumn of
1590 saw Hideyoshi master of Japan from end to end, and saw
Tokugawa Iyeyasu established at Yedo as recognized ruler of
the eight provinces of the Kwant&#333;. These two facts should be
bracketed together, because Japan&rsquo;s emergence from the deep
gloom of long-continued civil strife was due not more to the
brilliant qualities of Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu individually than to
the fortunate synchronism of their careers, so that the one was
able to carry the other&rsquo;s work to completion and permanence.
The last eight years of Hideyoshi&rsquo;s life&mdash;he died in 1598&mdash;were
chiefly remarkable for his attempt to invade China through
Korea, and for his attitude towards Christianity (see § VIII.:
<span class="sc">Foreign Intercourse</span>).</p>

<p><i>The Tokugawa Era</i>.&mdash;When Hideyoshi died he left a son,
Hideyori, then only six years of age, and the problem of this
child&rsquo;s future had naturally caused supreme solicitude to the
peasant statesman. He finally entrusted the care of the boy
and the management of state affairs to five regents, five ministers,
and three intermediary councillors. But he placed chief reliance
upon Iyeyasu, whom he appointed president of the board of
regents. Among the latter was one, Ishida Mitsunari, who to
insatiable ambition added an extraordinary faculty for intrigue
and great personal magnetism. These qualities he utilized with
such success that the dissensions among the daimy&#333;s, which had
been temporarily composed by Hideyoshi, broke out again, and
the year 1600 saw Japan divided into two camps, one composed
of Tokugawa Iyeyasu and his allies, the other of Ishida Mitsunari
and his partisans.</p>

<p>The situation of Iyeyasu was eminently perilous. From his
position in the east of the country, he found himself menaced
by two powerful enemies on the north and on the
south, respectively, the former barely contained by
<span class="sidenote">Iyeyasu.</span>
a greatly weaker force of his friends, and the latter moving up
in seemingly overwhelming strength from Ki&#333;to. He decided
to hurl himself upon the southern army without awaiting the
result of the conflict in the north. The encounter took place
at Sekigahara in the province of Mino on the 21st of October
1600. The army of Iyeyasu had to move to the attack in such a
manner that its left flank and its left rear were threatened by
divisions of the enemy posted on commanding eminences. But
with the leaders of these divisions Iyeyasu had come to an understanding
by which they could be trusted to abide so long as
victory did not declare against him. Such incidents were
naturally common in an era when every man fought for his
own hand. The southerners suffered a crushing defeat. The
survivors fled pell-mell to Osaka, where in a colossal fortress,
built by Hideyoshi, his son, Hideyori, and the latter&rsquo;s mother,
Yodo, were sheltered behind ramparts held <span class="correction" title="added by">by</span> 80,000 men.
Hideyori&rsquo;s cause had been openly put forward by Ishida Mitsunari
and his partisans, but Iyeyasu made no immediate
attempt to visit the sin upon the head of his deceased benefactor&rsquo;s
child. On the contrary, he sent word to the lady Yodo and
her little boy that he absolved them of all complicity. The
battle of Sekigahara is commonly spoken of as having terminated
the civil war which had devastated Japan, with brief intervals,
from the latter half of the 12th century to the beginning of the
17th. That is incorrect in view of the fact that Sekigahara was
followed by other fighting, especially by the terrible conflict at
Osaka in 1615 when Yodo and her son perished. But Sekigahara&rsquo;s
importance cannot be over-rated. For had Iyeyasu been
finally crushed there, the wave of internecine strife must have
rolled again over the empire until providence provided another
Hideyoshi and another Iyeyasu to stem it. Sekigahara, therefore,
may be truly described as a turning-point in Japan&rsquo;s
career and as one of the decisive battles of the world. As for
the fact that the Tokugawa leader did not at once proceed to
extremities in the case of the boy Hideyori, though the events
of the Sekigahara campaign had made it quite plain that such a
course would ultimately be inevitable, we have to remember
that only two years had elapsed since Hideyoshi was laid in his
grave. His memory was still green and the glory of his achievements
still enveloped his family. Iyeyasu foresaw that to carry
the tragedy to its bitter end at once must have forced into Hideyori&rsquo;s
camp many puissant daimy&#333;s whose sense of allegiance
would grow less cogent with the lapse of time. When he did lay
siege to the Osaka castle in 1615, the power of the Tokugawa was
well-nigh shattered against its ramparts; had not the onset been
aided by treachery, the stronghold would probably have proved
impregnable.</p>

<p>But signal as were the triumphs of the Tokugawa chieftain in
the field, what distinguishes him from all his predecessors is the
ability he displayed in consolidating his conquests. The immense
estates that fell into his hands he parcelled out in such a
manner that all important strategical positions were held by
daimy&#333;s whose fidelity could be confidently trusted, and every
feudatory of doubtful loyalty found his fief within touch of a
Tokugawa partisan. This arrangement, supplemented by a
system which required all the great daimy&#333;s to have mansions in
the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s capital. Yedo, to keep their families there always
and to reside there themselves in alternate years, proved so
potent a check to disaffection that from 1615, when the castle of
Osaka fell, until 1864, when the Ch&#333;sh&#363; r&#333;nin attacked Ki&#333;to,
Japan remained entirely free from civil war.</p>

<p>It is possible to form a clear idea of the ethical and administrative
principles by which Iyeyasu and the early Tokugawa
chiefs were guided in elaborating the system which gave to
Japan an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity. Evidence
is furnished not only by the system itself but also by the contents
of a document generally called the <i>Testament of Iyeyasu</i>,
though probably it was not fully compiled until the time of his
grandson, Iyemitsu (1623-1650). The great Tokugawa chief,
though he munificently patronized Buddhism and though he
carried constantly in his bosom a miniature Buddhist image to
which he ascribed all his success in the field and his safety in
battle, took his ethical code from Confucius. He held that the
basis of all legislation and administration should be the five
relations of sovereign and subject, parent and child, husband
and wife, brother and sister, friend and friend. The family
was, in his eyes, the essential foundation of society, to be maintained
at all sacrifices. Beyond these broad outlines of moral
duty it was not deemed necessary to instruct the people. Therefore
out of the hundred chapters forming the <i>Testament</i> only
22 contain what can be called legal enactments, while 55 relate
to administration and politics; 16 set forth moral maxims and
reflections, and the remainder record illustrative episodes in the
career of the author. No distinct line is drawn between law
and morals, between the duty of a citizen and the virtues of a
member of a family. Substantive law is entirely wanting, just
as it was wanting in the so-called constitution of Prince Sh&#333;toku.
Custom, as sanctioned by public observance, must be complied
with in the civil affairs of life. What required minute exposition
was criminal law, the relations of social classes, etiquette, rank,
precedence, administration and government.</p>

<p>Society under feudalism had been moulded into three sharply
defined groups, namely, first, the Throne and the court nobles
(<i>kuge</i>); secondly, the military class (<i>buke</i> or <i>samurai</i>);
and thirdly, the common people (<i>heimin</i>). These lines
<span class="sidenote">Social distinctions in the Tokugawa Era.</span>
of cleavage were emphasized as much as possible
by the Tokugawa rulers. The divine origin of the
mikado was held to separate him from contact with mundane
affairs, and he was therefore strictly secluded in the palace at
Ki&#333;to, his main function being to mediate between his heavenly
ancestors and his subjects, entrusting to the sh&#333;gun and the
samurai the duty of transacting all worldly business on behalf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
of the state. In obedience to this principle the mikado became
a kind of sacrosanct abstraction. No one except his consorts
and his chief ministers ever saw his face. In the rare cases
when he gave audience to a privileged subject, he sat behind a
curtain, and when he went abroad, he rode in a closely shut car
drawn by oxen. A revenue of ten thousand <i>koku</i> of rice&mdash;the
equivalent of about as many guineas&mdash;was apportioned for his
support, and the right was reserved to him of conferring empty
titles upon the living and rank upon the dead. His majesty had
one wife, the empress (<i>k&#333;g&#333;</i>), necessarily taken from one of the
five chosen families (<i>go-sekke</i>) of the Fujiwara, but he might also
have twelve consorts, and if direct issue failed, the succession
passed to one of the two princely families of Arisugawa and
Fushimi, adoption, however, being possible in the last resort.
The <i>kuge</i> constituted the court nobility, consisting of 155 families
all of whom traced their lineage to ancient mikados; they ranked
far above the feudal chiefs, not excepting even the sh&#333;gun;
filled by right of heredity nearly all the offices at the court, the
emoluments attached being, however, a mere pittance; were
entirely without the great estates which had belonged to them
in ante-feudal times, and lived lives of proud poverty, occupying
themselves with the study of literature and the practice of music
and art. After the kuge and at a long distance below them in
theoretical rank came the military families, who, as a class,
were called <i>buke</i> or <i>samurai</i>. They had hereditary revenues,
and they filled the administrative posts, these, too, being often
hereditary. The third, and by far the most numerous, section
of the nation were the commoners (<i>heimin</i>). They had no
social status; were not allowed to carry swords, and possessed
no income except what they could earn with their hands.
About 55 in every 1000 units of the nation were samurai, the
latter&rsquo;s wives and children being included in this estimate.</p>

<p>Under the H&#333;j&#333; and the Ashikaga sh&#333;guns the holders of
the great estates changed frequently according to the vicissitudes
of those troublesome times, but under the
Tokugawa no change took place, and there thus
<span class="sidenote">Daimy&#333;s.</span>
grew up a landed nobility of the most permanent character.
Every one of these estates was a feudal kingdom, large or small,
with its own usages and its own laws, based on the general
principles above indicated and liable to be judged according to
those principles by the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s government (<i>baku-fu</i>) in Yedo.
A daimy&#333; or feudal chief drew from the peasants on his estate
the means of subsistence for himself and his retainers. For this
purpose the produce of his estate was assessed by the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s
officials in <i>koku</i> (one <i>koku</i> = 180.39 litres, worth about £1), and
about one-half of the assessed amount went to the feudatory,
the other half to the tillers of the soil. The richest daimy&#333; was
Mayeda of Kaga, whose fief was assessed at a little over a million
<i>koku</i>, his revenue thus being about half a million sterling. Just
as an empress had to be taken from one of five families designated
to that distinction for all time, so a successor to the sh&#333;gunate,
failing direct heir, had to be selected from three families
(<i>sanke</i>), namely, those of the daimy&#333;s of Owari, Kii and Mito,
whose first representatives were three sons of Iyeyasu. Out
of the total body of 255 daimy&#333;s existing in the year 1862,
141 were specially distinguished as <i>fudai</i>, or hereditary vassals
of the Tokugawa house, and to 18 of these was strictly
limited the perpetual privilege of filling all the high offices
in the Yedo administration, while to 4 of them was reserved
the special honour of supplying a regent (<i>go-tair&#333;</i>) during the
minority of the sh&#333;gun. Moreover, a <i>fudai</i> daimy&#333; was of
necessity appointed to the command of the fortress of
Nij&#333; in Ki&#333;to as well as of the great castles of Osaka and
Fushimi, which Iyeyasu designated the keys of the country.
No intermarriage might take place between members of the
court nobility and the feudal houses without the consent of
Yedo; no daimy&#333; might apply direct to the emperor for an
official title, or might put foot within the imperial district of
Ki&#333;to without the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s permit, and at all entrances to the
region known as the Kwant&#333; there were established guardhouses,
where every one, of whatever rank, must submit to be
examined, in order to prevent the wives and children of the
daimy&#333;s from secretly leaving Yedo for their own provinces.
In their journeys to and from Yedo every second year the feudal
chiefs had to travel by one of two great highways, the T&#333;kaid&#333;
or the Nakasend&#333;, and as they moved with great retinues,
these roads were provided with a number of inns and tea-houses
equipped in a sumptuous manner, and having an abundance of
female servants. A puissant daimy&#333;&rsquo;s procession often numbered
as many as 1000 retainers, and nothing illustrates more
forcibly the wide interval that separated the soldier and the
plebeian than the fact that at the appearance of the heralds who
preceded these progresses all commoners who happened to be
abroad had to kneel on the ground with bowed and uncovered
heads; all wayside houses had to close the shutters of windows
giving on the road, and none might venture to look down from a
height on the passing magnate. Any violation of these rules of
etiquette exposed the violator to instant death at the hands of
the daimy&#333;&rsquo;s retinue. Moreover, the samurai and the heimin
lived strictly apart. A feudal chief had a castle which generally
occupied a commanding position. It was surrounded by from
one to three broad moats, the innermost crowned with a high
wall of huge cut stones, its trace arranged so as to give flank
defence, which was further provided by pagoda-like towers
placed at the salient angles. Inside this wall stood the houses
of the high officials on the outskirts of a park surrounding the
residence of the daimy&#333; himself, and from the scarps of the moats
or in the intervals between them rose houses for the military
retainers, barrack-like structures, provided, whenever possible,
with small but artistically arranged and carefully tended gardens.
All this domain of the military was called <i>yashiki</i> in distinction
to the <i>machi</i> (streets) where the despised commoners had their
habitat.</p>

<p>The general body of the samurai received stipends and lived
frugally. Their pay was not reckoned in money: it took the
form of so many rations of rice delivered from
their chief&rsquo;s granaries. A few had landed estates,
<span class="sidenote">Samurai.</span>
usually bestowed in recognition of conspicuous merit. They
were probably the finest type of hereditary soldiers the world
ever produced. Money and all devices for earning it they profoundly
despised. The right of wearing a sword was to them
the highest conceivable privilege. They counted themselves
the guardians of their fiefs&rsquo; honour and of their country&rsquo;s welfare.
At any moment they were prepared cheerfully to sacrifice their
lives on the altar of loyalty. Their word, once given, must never
be violated. The slightest insult to their honour might not be
condoned. Stoicism was a quality which they esteemed next
to courage: all outward display of emotion must be suppressed.
The sword might never be drawn for a petty cause, but, if once
drawn, must never be returned to its scabbard until it had done
its duty. Martial exercises occupied much of their attention,
but book learning also they esteemed highly. They were profoundly
courteous towards each other, profoundly contemptuous
towards the commoner, whatever his wealth. Filial piety ranked
next to loyalty in their code of ethics. Thus the Confucian
maxim, endorsed explicitly in the <i>Testament of Iyeyasu</i>, that a
man must not live under the same sky with his father&rsquo;s murderer
or his brother&rsquo;s slayer, received most literal obedience,
and many instances occurred of vendettas pursued in the face of
apparently insuperable difficulties and consummated after years
of effort. By the standard of modern morality the Japanese
samurai would be counted cruel. Holding that death was the
natural sequel of defeat and the only certain way of avoiding
disgrace, he did not seek quarter himself or think of extending it
to an enemy. Yet in his treatment of the latter he loved to display
courtesy until the supreme moment when all considerations
of mercy were laid aside. It cannot be doubted that the practice
of employing torture judicially tended to educate a mood
of callousness towards suffering, or that the many idle hours of a
military man&rsquo;s life in time of peace encouraged a measure of
dissipation. But there does not seem to be any valid ground for
concluding that either of these defects was conspicuous in
the character of the Japanese samurai. Faithlessness towards
women was the greatest fault that can be laid to his door. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
samurai lady claimed no privilege of timidity on account of her
sex. She knew how to die in the cause of honour just as readily
as her husband, her father or her brother died, and conjugal
fidelity did not rank as a virtue in her eyes, being regarded as a
simple duty. But her husband held marital faith in small
esteem and ranked his wife far below his sword. It has to be
remembered that when we speak of a samurai&rsquo;s suicide, there is
no question of poison, the bullet, drowning or any comparatively
painless manner of exit from the world. The invariable method
was to cut open the abdomen (<i>hara-kiri</i> or <i>seppuku</i>) and afterwards,
if strength remained, the sword was turned against the
throat. To such endurance had the samurai trained himself
that he went through this cruel ordeal without flinching in the
smallest degree.</p>

<p>The heimin or commoners were divided into three classes&mdash;husbandmen,
artisans and traders. The farmer, as the nation
lived by his labour, was counted the most respectable
among the bread-winners, and a cultivator
<span class="sidenote">Heimin.</span>
of his own estate might even carry one sword but never two,
that privilege being strictly reserved to a samurai. The artisan,
too, received much consideration, as is easily understood when
we remember that included in his ranks were artists, sword-smiths,
armourers, sculptors of sacred images or sword-furniture,
ceramists and lacquerers. Many artisans were in the permanent
service of feudal chiefs from whom they received fixed salaries.
Tradesmen, however, were regarded with disdain and stood
lowest of all in the social organization. Too much despised to
be even included in that organization were the <i>eta</i> (defiled
folks) and the <i>hinin</i> (outcasts). The exact origin of these latter
pariahs is uncertain, but the ancestors of the eta would seem to
have been prisoners of war or the enslaved families of criminals.
To such people were assigned the defiling duties of tending tombs,
disposing of the bodies of the dead, slaughtering animals or
tanning hides. The hinin were mendicants. On them devolved
the task of removing and burying the corpses of executed criminals.
Living in segregated hamlets, forbidden to marry with
heimin, still less with samurai, not allowed to eat, drink or
associate with persons above their own class, the eta remained
under the ban of ostracism from generation to generation,
though many of them contrived to amass much wealth. They
were governed by their own headmen, and they had three
chiefs, one residing in each of the cities of Yedo, Osaka and
Ki&#333;to. All these members of the submerged classes were
relieved from proscription and admitted to the ranks of the
commoners under the enlightened system of Meiji. The 12th
of October 1871 saw their enfranchisement, and at that date
the census showed 287,111 eta and 695,689 hinin.</p>

<p>Naturally, as the unbroken peace of the Tokugawa régime
became habitual, the mood of the nation underwent a change.
The samurai, no longer required to lead the frugal
life of camp or barracks, began to live beyond their
<span class="sidenote">Decline and Fall of the Sh&#333;gunate.</span>
incomes. &ldquo;They found difficulty in meeting the
pecuniary engagements of everyday existence, so that money
acquired new importance in their eyes, and they gradually
forfeited the respect which their traditional disinterestedness
had won for them in the past.&rdquo; At the same time the
abuses of feudalism were thrown into increased salience. A
large body of hereditary soldiers become an anomaly when
fighting has passed even out of memory. On the other
hand, the agricultural and commercial classes acquired new
importance. The enormous sums disbursed every year in
Yedo, for the maintenance of the great establishments
which the feudal chiefs vied with each other in keeping there,
enriched the merchants and traders so greatly that their
scale of living underwent radical change. Buddhism was a
potent influence, but its ethical restraints were weakened by
the conduct of its priests, who themselves often yielded to the
temptation of the time. The aristocracy adhered to its refined
pastimes&mdash;performances of the <i>No</i>; tea reunions; poem
composing; polo; football; equestrian archery; fencing and
gambling&mdash;but the commoner, being excluded from all this
realm and, at the same time, emerging rapidly from his old
position of penury and degradation, began to develop luxurious
proclivities and to demand corresponding amusements. Thus
the theatre came into existence; the dancing girl and the
jester found lucrative employment; a popular school of art
was founded and quickly carried to perfection; the <i>lupanar</i>
assumed unprecedented dimensions; rich and costly costumes
acquired wide vogue in despite of sumptuary laws enacted
from time to time; wrestling became an important institution,
and plutocracy asserted itself in the face of caste distinctions.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the change of social conditions thus
taking place, history repeated itself at the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s court. The
substance of administrative power passed into the hands of a
minister, its shadow alone remaining to the sh&#333;gun. During
only two generations were the successors of Iyeyasu able to resist
this traditional tendency. The representative of the third&mdash;Iyetsuna
(1661-1680)&mdash;succumbed to the machinations of an
ambitious minister, Sakai Takakiyo, and it may be said that from
that time the nominal repository of administrative authority in
Yedo was generally a species of magnificent recluse, secluded
from contact with the outer world and seeing and hearing only
through the eyes and ears of the ladies of his household. In
this respect the descendants of the great Tokugawa statesman
found themselves reduced to a position precisely analogous to
that of the emperor in Ki&#333;to. Sovereign and sh&#333;gun were
alike mere abstractions so far as the practical work of
government was concerned. With the great mass of the feudal
chiefs things fared similarly. These men who, in the days of
Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu, had directed the policies of
their fiefs and led their armies in the field, were gradually transformed,
during the long peace of the Tokugawa era, into voluptuous
<i>fainéants</i> or, at best, thoughtless dilettanti, willing to
abandon the direction of their affairs to seneschals and mayors,
who, while on the whole their administration was able and
loyal, found their account in contriving and perpetuating the
effacement of their chiefs. Thus, in effect, the government
of the country, taken out of the hands of the sh&#333;gun and the
feudatories, fell into those of their vassals. There were exceptions,
of course, but so rare as to be merely accidental.</p>

<p>Another important factor has to be noted. It has been
shown above that Iyeyasu bestowed upon his three sons the rich
fiefs of Owari, Kii (Kish&#363;) and Mito, and that these three
families exclusively enjoyed the privilege of furnishing an heir
to the sh&#333;gun should the latter be without direct issue. Mito
ought therefore to have been a most unlikely place for the
conception and propagation of principles subversive of the
sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s administrative autocracy. Nevertheless, in the days
of the second of the Mito chiefs at the close of the 17th century,
there arose in that province a school of thinkers who, revolting
against the ascendancy of Chinese literature and of Buddhism,
devoted themselves to compiling a history such as should recall
the attention of the nation to its own annals and revive its
allegiance to Shint&#333;. It would seem that in patronizing the
compilation of this great work the Mito chief was swayed by
the spirit of pure patriotism and studentship, and that he
discerned nothing of the goal to which the new researches must
lead the litterati of his fief. &ldquo;He and they, for the sake of
history and without any thought of politics, undertook a retrospect
of their country&rsquo;s annals, and their frank analysis furnished
conclusive proof that the emperor was the prime source of
administrative authority and that its independent exercise
by a sh&#333;gun must be regarded as a usurpation. They did not
attempt to give practical effect to their discoveries; the era was
essentially academical. But this galaxy of scholars projected
into the future a light which burned with growing force in each
succeeding generation and ultimately burst into a flame which
consumed feudalism and the sh&#333;gunate,&rdquo; fused the nation into
one, and restored the governing authority to the emperor.
Of course the Mito men were not alone in this matter: many
students subsequently trod in their footsteps and many others
sought to stem the tendency; but the net result was fatal to
faith in the dual system of government. Possibly had nothing
occurred to furnish signal proof of the system&rsquo;s practical defects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
it might have long survived this theoretical disapproval.
But the crisis caused by the advent of foreign ships and by the
forceful renewal of foreign intercourse in the 19th century
afforded convincing evidence of the sh&#333;gunate&rsquo;s incapacity to
protect the state&rsquo;s supposed interests and to enforce the traditional
policy of isolation which the nation had learned to consider
essential to the empire&rsquo;s integrity.</p>

<p>Another important factor made for the fall of the sh&#333;gunate.
That factor was the traditional disaffection of the two great
southern fiefs, Satsuma and Ch&#333;sh&#363;. When Iyeyasu parcelled
out the empire, he deemed it the wisest policy to leave these
chieftains in full possession of their large estates. But this
measure, construed as an evidence of weakness rather than
a token of liberality, neither won the allegiance of the big
feudatories nor cooled their ambition. Thus no sooner did
the nation divide into two camps over the question of renewed
foreign intercourse than men of the above clans, in concert
with representatives of certain of the old court nobles, placed
themselves at the head of a movement animated by two loudly
proclaimed purposes: restoration of the administration to the
emperor, and expulsion of aliens. This latter aspiration underwent
a radical change when the bombardment of the Satsuma
capital, Kagoshima, and the destruction of the Ch&#333;sh&#363; forts
and ships at Shimonoseki proved conclusively to the Satsuma
and Ch&#333;sh&#363; clans that Japan in her unequipped and backward
condition could not hope to stand for a moment against the
Occident in arms. But the unwelcome discovery was accompanied
by a conviction that only a thoroughly united nation
might aspire to preserve its independence, and thus the abolition
of the dual form of government became more than ever an
article of public faith. It is unnecessary to recount the successive
incidents which conspired to undermine the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s
authority, and to destroy the prestige of the Yedo administration.
Both had been reduced to vanishing quantities by the year 1866
when Keiki succeeded to the sh&#333;gunate.</p>

<p>Keiki, known historically as Yoshinobu, the last of the
sh&#333;guns, was a man of matured intellect and high capacities.
He had been put forward by the anti-foreign Conservatives
for the succession to the sh&#333;gunate in 1857 when the complications
of foreign intercourse were in their first stage of acuteness.
But, like many other intelligent Japanese, he had learned,
in the interval between 1857 and 1866, that to keep her doors
closed was an impossible task for Japan, and very quickly
after taking the reins of office he recognized that national
union could never be achieved while power was divided between
Ki&#333;to and Yedo. At this juncture there was addressed to
him by Y&#333;d&#333;, chief of the great Tosa fief, a memorial setting
forth the hopelessness of the position in which the Yedo court
now found itself, and urging that, in the interests of good
government and in order that the nation&rsquo;s united strength
might be available to meet the exigencies of its new career,
the administration should be restored to the emperor. Keiki
received this memorial in Ki&#333;to. He immediately summoned
a council of all the feudatories and high officials then in the
Imperial city, announced to them his intention to lay down his
office, and, the next day, presented his resignation to the
sovereign. This happened on the 14th of October 1867.
It must be ranked among the signal events of the world&rsquo;s
history, for it signified the voluntary surrender of kingly
authority wielded uninterruptedly for nearly three centuries.
That the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s resignation was tendered in good faith
there can be no doubt, and had it been accepted in the same
spirit, the great danger it involved might have been consummated
without bloodshed or disorder. But the clansmen of
Satsuma and Ch&#333;sh&#363; were distrustful. One of the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s
first acts after assuming office had been to obtain from the throne
an edict for imposing penalties on Ch&#333;sh&#363;, and there was a
precedent for suspecting that the renunciation of power by
the sh&#333;gun might merely prelude its resumption on a firmer
basis. Therefore steps were taken to induce the emperor,
then a youth of fifteen, to issue a secret rescript to Satsuma
and Ch&#333;sh&#363;, denouncing the sh&#333;gun as the nation&rsquo;s enemy and
enjoining his destruction. At the same time all officials connected
with the Tokugawa or suspected of sympathy with
them were expelled from office in Ki&#333;to, and the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s
troops were deprived of the custody of the palace gates by
methods which verged upon the use of armed force. In the
face of such provocation Keiki&rsquo;s earnest efforts to restrain
the indignation of his vassals and adherents failed. They
marched against Ki&#333;to and were defeated, whereupon Keiki left
his castle at Osaka and retired to Yedo, where he subsequently
made unconditional surrender to the Imperial army. There is
little more to be set down on this page of the history. The
Yedo court consented to lay aside its dignities and be stripped
of its administrative authority, but all the Tokugawa vassals
and adherents did not prove equally placable. There was resistance
in the northern provinces, where the Aizu feudatory
refused to abandon the Tokugawa cause; there was an attempt
to set up a rival candidate for the throne in the person of an
Imperial prince who presided over the Uyeno Monastery in
Yedo; and there was a wild essay on the part of the admiral
of the sh&#333;gun&rsquo;s fleet to establish a republic in the island of
Yezo. But these were mere ripples on the surface of the broad
stream which set towards the peaceful overthrow of the dual
system of government and ultimately towards the fall of
feudalism itself. That this system, the outcome of five centuries
of nearly continuous warfare, was swept away in almost as many
weeks with little loss of life or destruction of property constitutes,
perhaps, the most striking incident, certainly the most
momentous, in the history of the Japanese nation.</p>

<p><i>The Meiji Era</i>.&mdash;It must be remembered that when reference
is made to the Japanese nation in connexion with these
radical changes, only the nobles and the samurai are indicated&mdash;in
other words, a section of the population representing about
one-sixteenth of the whole. The bulk of the people&mdash;the
agricultural, the industrial and the mercantile classes&mdash;remained
outside the sphere of politics, not sharing the anti-foreign prejudice,
or taking any serious interest in the great questions of the
time. Foreigners often noted with surprise the contrast between
the fierce antipathy displayed towards them by certain
samurai on the one hand, and the genial, hospitable reception
given to them by the common people on the other. History
teaches that the latter was the natural disposition of the Japanese,
the former a mood educated by special experiences. Further,
even the comparatively narrow statement that the restoration
of the administrative power to the emperor was the work of the
nobles and the samurai must be taken with limitations. A
majority of the nobles entertained no idea of any necessity for
change. They were either held fast in the vice of Tokugawa
authority, or paralyzed by the sensuous seductions of the lives
provided for them by the machinations of their retainers, who
transferred the administrative authority of the fiefs to their
own hands, leaving its shadow only to their lords. It was among
the retainers that longings for a new order of things were generated.
Some of these men were sincere disciples of progress&mdash;a
small band of students and deep thinkers who, looking through
the narrow Dutch window at Deshima, had caught a glimmering
perception of the realities that lay beyond the horizon of their
country&rsquo;s prejudices. But the influence of such Liberals was comparatively
insignificant. Though they showed remarkable moral
courage and tenacity of purpose, the age did not furnish any
strong object lesson to enforce their propaganda of progress.
The factors chiefly making for change were, first, the ambition
of the southern clans to oust the Tokugawa, and, secondly, the
samurai&rsquo;s loyal instinct, reinforced by the teachings of his
country&rsquo;s history, by the revival of the Shint&#333; cult, by the
promptings of national enterprise, and by the object-lessons of
foreign intercourse.</p>

<p>But though essentially imperialistic in its prime purposes,
the revolution which involved the fall of the sh&#333;gunate, and
ultimately of feudalism, may be called democratic with
regard to the personnel of those who planned and
<span class="sidenote">Character of the Revolution.</span>
directed it. They were, for the most part, men without
either official rank or social standing. That is a point essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
to a clear understanding of the issue. Fifty-five individuals may
be said to have planned and carried out the overthrow of the
Yedo administration, and only five of them were territorial
nobles. Eight, belonging to the court nobility, laboured under
the traditional disadvantages of their class, poverty and political
insignificance; and the remaining forty-two, the hearts and hands
of the movement, may be described as ambitious youths, who
sought to make a career for themselves in the first place, and
for their country in the second. The average age of the whole
did not exceed thirty. There was another element for which
any student of Japanese history might have been prepared: the
Satsuma samurai aimed originally not merely at overthrowing
the Tokugawa but also at obtaining the sh&#333;gunate for their own
chief. Possibly it would be unjust to say that all the leaders
of the great southern clan harboured that idea. But some of
them certainly did, and not until they had consented to abandon
the project did their union with Ch&#333;sh&#363;, the other great southern
clan, become possible&mdash;a union without which the revolution
could scarcely have been accomplished. This ambition of the
Satsuma clansmen deserves special mention, because it bore
remarkable fruit; it may be said to have laid the foundation of
constitutional government in Japan. For, in consequence of
the distrust engendered by such aspirations, the authors of the
Restoration agreed that when the emperor assumed the reins of
power, he should solemnly pledge himself to convene a deliberative
assembly, to appoint to administrative posts men of
intellect and erudition wherever they might be found, and to
decide all measures in accordance with public opinion. This
promise, referred to frequently in later times as the Imperial
oath at the Restoration, came to be accounted the basis of representative
institutions, though in reality it was intended solely
as a guarantee against the political ascendancy of any one clan.</p>

<p>At the outset the necessity of abolishing feudalism did not
present itself clearly to the leaders of the revolution. Their
sole idea was the unification of the nation. But
when they came to consider closely the practical
<span class="sidenote">The Anti-feudal Idea.</span>
side of the problem, they understood how far it
would lead them. Evidently that one homogeneous system
of law should replace the more or less heterogeneous systems
operative in the various fiefs was essential, and such a
substitution meant that the feudatories must be deprived
of their local autonomy and, incidentally, of their control of
local finances. That was a stupendous change. Hitherto each
feudal chief had collected the revenues of his fief and had employed
them at will, subject to the sole condition of maintaining
a body of troops proportionate to his income. He had been, and
was still, an autocrat within the limits of his territory. On the
other hand, the active authors of the revolution were a small
band of men mainly without prestige or territorial influence. It
was impossible that they should dictate any measure sensibly
impairing the local and fiscal autonomy of the feudatories. No
power capable of enforcing such a measure existed at the time.
All the great political changes in Japan had formerly been
preceded by wars culminating in the accession of some strong
clan to supreme authority, whereas in this case there had been a
displacement without a substitution&mdash;the Tokugawa had been
overthrown and no new administrators had been set up in their
stead. It was, moreover, certain that an attempt on the part of
any one clan to constitute itself executor of the sovereign&rsquo;s
mandates would have stirred the other clans to vehement resistance.
In short, the leaders of the revolution found themselves
pledged to a new theory of government without any machinery
for carrying it into effect, or any means of abolishing the old
practice. An ingenious exit from this curious dilemma was
devised by the young reformers. They induced the feudal chiefs
of Satsuma, Ch&#333;sh&#363;, Tosa and Hizen, the four most powerful
clans in the south, publicly to surrender their fiefs to the
emperor, praying his majesty to reorganize them and to bring
them all under the same system of law. In the case of Shimazu,
chief of Satsuma, and Y&#333;d&#333;, chief of Tosa, this act must stand to
their credit as a noble sacrifice. To them the exercise of power
had been a reality and the effort of surrendering it must have
been correspondingly costly. But the chiefs of Ch&#333;sh&#363; and Hizen
obeyed the suggestions of their principal vassals with little, if
any, sense of the probable cost of obedience. The same remark
applies to all the other feudatories, with exceptions so rare as to
emphasize the rule. They had long been accustomed to abandon
the management of their affairs to their leading clansmen, and
they allowed themselves to follow the same guidance at this
crisis. Out of more than 250 feudatories, only 17 hesitated to
imitate the example of the four southern fiefs.</p>

<p>An explanation of this remarkable incident has been sought by
supposing that the samurai of the various clans, when they
advised a course so inconsistent with fidelity to
the interests of their feudal chiefs, were influenced
<span class="sidenote">Motives of the Reformers.</span>
by motives of personal ambition, imagining that
they themselves might find great opportunities under the new
régime. Some hope of that kind may fairly be assumed, and was
certainly realized, in the case of the leading samurai of the four
southern clans which headed the movement. But it is plain
that no such expectations can have been generally entertained.
The simplest explanation seems to be the true one: a certain
course, indicated by the action of the four southern clans, was
conceived to be in accord with the spirit of the Restoration, and
not to adopt it would have been to shrink publicly from a sacrifice
dictated by the principle of loyalty to the Throne&mdash;a principle
which had acquired supreme sanctity in the eyes of the men of
that era. There might have been some uncertainty about the
initial step; but so soon as that was taken by the southern clans
their example acquired compelling force. History shows that
in political crises the Japanese samurai is generally ready to pay
deference to certain canons of almost romantic morality. There
was a fever of loyalty and of patriotism in the air of the year
1869. Any one hesitating, for obviously selfish reasons, to adopt
a precedent such as that offered by the procedure of the great
southern clans, would have seemed to forfeit the right of calling
himself a samurai. But although the leaders of this remarkable
movement now understood that they must contrive the total
abolition of feudalism and build up a new administrative edifice
on foundations of constitutional monarchy, they appreciated
the necessity of advancing slowly towards a goal which still lay
beyond the range of their followers&rsquo; vision. Thus the first steps
taken after the surrender of the fiefs were to appoint the feudatories
to the position of governors in the districts over which they
had previously ruled; to confirm the samurai in the possession
of their incomes and official positions; to put an end to the distinction
between court nobles and territorial nobles, and to
organize in Ki&#333;to a cabinet consisting of the leaders of the
restoration. Each new governor received one-tenth of the
income of the fief by way of emoluments; the pay of the officials
and the samurai, as well as the administrative expenses of the
district, was defrayed from the same source, and the residue, if
any, was to pass into the treasury of the central government.</p>

<p>The defects of this system from a monarchical point of view
soon became evident. It did not give the power of either
the purse or the sword to the sovereign. The
revenues of the administrative districts continued
<span class="sidenote">Defects of the First Measures.</span>
to be collected and disbursed by the former
feudatories, who also retained the control of the troops, the
right of appointing and dismissing officials, and almost complete
local autonomy. A further radical step had to be
taken, and the leaders of reform, seeing nothing better than
to continue the method of procedure which had thus far proved
so successful, contrived, first, that several of the administrative
districts should send in petitions offering to surrender their local
autonomy and be brought under the direct rule of the central
government; secondly, that a number of samurai should apply
for permission to lay aside their swords. While the nation was
digesting the principles embodied in these petitions, the government
made preparations for further measures of reform. The
ex-chief of Satsuma, who showed some umbrage because the
services of his clan in promoting the restoration had not been
more fully recognized, was induced to take high ministerial office,
as were also the ex-chiefs of Ch&#333;sh&#363; and Tosa. Each of the four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
great clans had now three representatives in the ministry.
These clans were further persuaded to send to T&#333;ky&#333;&mdash;whither
the emperor had moved his court&mdash;contingents of troops to
form the nucleus of a national army. Importance attaches to
these details because the principle of clan representation,
illustrated in the organization of the cabinet of 1871, continued
to be approximately observed for many years in forming
ministries, and ultimately became a target for the attacks of
party politicians.</p>

<p>On the 29th of August 1871 an Imperial decree announced
the abolition of the system of local autonomy, and the removal
of the territorial nobles from the posts of governor.
The taxes of the former fiefs were to be paid thenceforth
<span class="sidenote">Adoption of Radical Measures.</span>
into the central treasury; all officials were to
be appointed by the Imperial government, and the feudatories,
retaining permanently an income of one-tenth of their original
revenues, were to make T&#333;ky&#333; their place of residence. As for
the samurai, they remained for the moment in possession of
their hereditary pensions. Radical as these changes seem, the
disturbance caused by them was not great, since they left the
incomes of the military class untouched. Some of the incomes
were for life only, but the majority were hereditary, and all had
been granted in consideration of their holders devoting themselves
to military service. Four hundred thousand men approximately
were in receipt of such emoluments, and the total amount
annually taken from the tax-payers for this purpose was about
£2,000,000. Plainly the nation would have to be relieved of
this burden sooner or later. The samurai were essentially an
element of the feudal system, and that they should survive the
latter&rsquo;s fall would have been incongruous. On the other hand,
suddenly and wholly to deprive these men and their families&mdash;a
total of some two million persons&mdash;of the means of subsistence on
which they had hitherto relied with absolute confidence, and in
return for which they and their forefathers had rendered faithful
service, would have been an act of inhumanity. It may easily
be conceived that this problem caused extreme perplexity to the
administrators of the new Japan. They left it unsolved for the
moment, trusting that time and the loyalty of the samurai themselves
would suggest some solution. As for the feudal chiefs,
who had now been deprived of all official status and reduced to the
position of private gentlemen, without even a patent of nobility
to distinguish them from ordinary individuals, they did not find
anything specially irksome or regrettable in their altered
position. No scrutiny had been made into the contents of their
treasuries. They were allowed to retain unquestioned possession
of all the accumulated funds of their former fiefs, and they also
became public creditors for annual allowances equal to one-tenth
of their feudal revenues. They had never previously been so
pleasantly circumstanced. It is true that they were entirely
stripped of all administrative and military authority; but since
their possession of such authority had been in most cases merely
nominal, they only felt the change as a relief from responsibility.</p>

<p>By degrees public opinion began to declare itself with regard
to the samurai. If they were to be absorbed into the bulk of
the people and to lose their fixed revenues, some
capital must be placed at their disposal to begin
<span class="sidenote">Treatment of the Samurai.</span>
the world again. The samurai themselves showed a
noble faculty of resignation. They had been a privileged class,
but they had purchased their privileges with their blood and
by serving as patterns of all the qualities most prized among
Japanese national characteristics. The record of their acts and
the recognition of the people entitled them to look for munificent
treatment at the hands of the government which they had been
the means of setting up. Yet none of these considerations
blinded them to the painful fact that the time had passed them
by; that no place existed for them in the new polity. Many of
them voluntarily stepped down into the company of the peasant
or the tradesman, and many others signified their willingness to
join the ranks of common bread-winners if some aid was given
to equip them for such a career. After two years&rsquo; consideration
the government took action. A decree announced, in 1873,
that the treasury was prepared to commute the pensions of the
samurai at the rate of six years&rsquo; purchase for hereditary pensions
and four years for life pensions&mdash;one-half of the commutation to
be paid in cash, and one-half in bonds bearing interest at the
rate of 8%. It will be seen that a perpetual pension of £10
would be exchanged for a payment of £30 in cash, together
with securities giving an income of £2, 8s.; and that a £10 life
pensioner received £20 in cash and securities yielding £1, 12s.
annually. It is scarcely credible that the samurai should have
accepted such an arrangement. Something, perhaps, must be
ascribed to their want of business knowledge, but the general
explanation is that they made a large sacrifice in the interests
of their country. Nothing in all their career as soldiers became
them better than their manner of abandoning it. They were
told that they might lay aside their swords, and many of them
did so, though from time immemorial they had cherished the
sword as the mark of a gentleman, the most precious possession
of a warrior, and the one outward evidence that distinguished
men of their order from common toilers after gain. They saw
themselves deprived of their military employment, were invited
to surrender more than one-half of the income it brought, and
knew that they were unprepared alike by education and by
tradition to earn bread in any calling save that of arms. Yet,
at the invitation of a government which they had helped to
establish, many of them bowed their heads quietly to this sharp
reverse of fortune. It was certainly a striking instance of the
fortitude and resignation which the creed of the samurai required
him to display in the presence of adversity. As yet, however,
the government&rsquo;s measures with regard to the samurai were not
compulsory. Men laid aside their swords and commuted their
pensions at their own option.</p>

<p>Meanwhile differences of opinion began to occur among the
leaders of progress themselves. Coalitions formed for destructive
purposes are often found unable to endure the
strain of constructive efforts. Such lack of cohesion
<span class="sidenote">Saig&#333; Takamori.</span>
might easily have been foreseen in the case of the
Japanese reformers. Young men without experience of public
affairs, or special education to fit them for responsible posts,
found the duty suddenly imposed on them not only of devising
administrative and fiscal systems universally applicable to a
nation hitherto divided into a congeries of semi-independent principalities,
but also of shaping the country&rsquo;s demeanour towards
novel problems of foreign intercourse and alien civilization. So
long as the heat of their assault upon the sh&#333;gunate fused them
into a homogeneous party they worked together successfully.
But when they had to build a brand-new edifice on the ruins of
a still vivid past, it was inevitable that their opinions should
vary as to the nature of the materials to be employed. In this
divergence of views many of the capital incidents of Japan&rsquo;s
modern history had their origin. Of the fifty-five men whose
united efforts had compassed the fall of the sh&#333;gunate, five
stood conspicuous above their colleagues. They were Iwakura
and Sanj&#333;, court nobles; Saig&#333; and Okubo, samurai of Satsuma,
and Kido, a samurai of Ch&#333;sh&#363;. In the second rank came many
men of great gifts, whose youth alone disqualified them for
prominence&mdash;It&#333;, the constructive statesman of the Meiji era,
who inspired nearly all the important measures of the time,
though he did not openly figure as their originator; Inouye,
who never lacked a resource or swerved from the dictates of
loyalty; Okuma, a politician of subtle, versatile and vigorous
intellect; Itagaki, the Rousseau of his era; and a score of others
created by the extraordinary circumstances with which they had
to deal. But the five first mentioned were the captains, the rest
only lieutenants. Among the five, four were sincere reformers&mdash;not free,
of course, from selfish motives, but truthfully bent
upon promoting the interests of their country before all other
aims. The fifth, Saig&#333; Takamori, was a man in whom boundless
ambition lay concealed under qualities of the noblest and
most enduring type. His absolute freedom from every trace
of sordidness gave currency to a belief that his aims were of the
simplest; the story of his career satisfied the highest canons
of the samurai; his massive physique, commanding presence and
sunny aspect impressed and attracted even those who had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
opportunity of admiring his life of self-sacrificing effort or appreciating
the remarkable military talent he possessed. In the first
part of his career, the elevation of his clan to supreme power
seems to have been his sole motive, but subsequently personal
ambition appears to have swayed him. To the consummation
of either object the preservation of the military class was essential.
By the swords of the samurai alone could a new <i>imperium
in imperio</i> be carved out. On the other hand, Saig&#333;&rsquo;s colleagues
in the ministry saw clearly not only that the samurai were an
unwarrantable burden on the nation, but also that their continued
existence after the fall of feudalism would be a menace to
public peace as well as an anomaly. Therefore they took the
steps already described, and followed them by a conscription law,
making every adult male liable for military service without
regard to his social standing. It is easy to conceive how painfully
unwelcome this conscription law proved to the samurai.
Many of them were not unwilling to commute their pensions,
since their creed had always forbidden them to care for money.
Many of them were not unwilling to abandon the habit of
carrying swords, since the adoption of foreign costume rendered
such a custom incongruous and inconvenient. But very few of
them could readily consent to step down from their cherished
position as the military class, and relinquish their traditional
title to bear the whole responsibility and enjoy the whole honour
of fighting their country&rsquo;s battles. They had supposed, not
unreasonably, that service in the army and navy would be
reserved exclusively for them and their sons, whereas now the
commonest rustic, mechanic or tradesman would be equally
eligible.</p>

<p>While the pain of this blow was still fresh there occurred a
trouble with Korea. The little state had behaved with insulting
contumely, and when Japan&rsquo;s course came to be
debated in T&#333;ky&#333;, a disruption resulted in the
<span class="sidenote">Split among the Reformers.</span>
ranks of the reformers. Saig&#333; saw in a foreign
war the sole remaining chance of achieving his ambition by
lawful means. The government&rsquo;s conscription scheme, yet in
its infancy, had not produced even the skeleton of an army. If
Korea had to be conquered, the samurai must be employed;
and their employment would mean, if not their rehabilitation, at
least their organization into a force which, under Saig&#333;&rsquo;s leadership,
might dictate a new policy. Other members of the cabinet
believed that the nation would be disgraced if it tamely endured
Korea&rsquo;s insults. Thus several influential voices swelled the
clamour for war. But a peace party offered strenuous opposition.
Its members saw the collateral issues of the problem,
and declared that the country must not think of taking up arms
during a period of radical transition. The final discussion took
place in the emperor&rsquo;s presence. The advocates of peace understood
the national significance of the issue and perceived that
they were debating, not merely whether there should be peace
or war, but whether the country should halt or advance on its
newly adopted path of progress. They prevailed, and four
members of the cabinet, including Saig&#333;, resigned. This rupture
was destined to have far-reaching consequences. One of the
seceders immediately raised the standard of revolt. Among the
devices employed by him to win adherents was an attempt to
fan into flame the dying embers of the anti-foreign sentiment.
The government easily crushed the insurrection. Another
seceder was Itagaki Taisuke. The third and most prominent
was Saig&#333;, who seems to have concluded from that moment that
he must abandon his aims or achieve them by force. He retired
to his native province of Satsuma, and applied his whole resources,
his great reputation and the devoted loyalty of a number
of able followers to organizing and equipping a strong body of
samurai. Matters were facilitated for him by the conservatism
of the celebrated Shimazu Sabur&#333;, former chief of Satsuma, who,
though not opposed to foreign intercourse, had been revolted
by the wholesale iconoclasm of the time, and by the indiscriminate
rejection of Japanese customs in favour of foreign.
He protested vehemently against what seemed to him a slavish
abandonment of the nation&rsquo;s individuality, and finding his
protest fruitless, he set himself to preserve in his own distant
province, where the writ of the Yedo government had never
run, the fashions, institutions and customs which his former
colleagues in the administration were ruthlessly rejecting.
Satsuma thus became a centre of conservative influences,
among which Saig&#333; and his constantly augmenting band of
samurai found a congenial environment. During four years
this breach between the central government and the southern
clan grew constantly.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile (1876) two extreme measures were adopted
by the government: a veto on the wearing of swords, and an
edict ordering the compulsory commutation of the
pensions and allowances received by the nobles and
<span class="sidenote">Final Abolition of Sword-wearing and Pensions.</span>
the samurai. Three years previously the discarding
of swords had been declared optional, and a scheme of
voluntary commutation had been announced. Many
had bowed quietly to the spirit of these enactments. But
many still retained their swords and drew their pensions as of
old, obstructing, in the former respect, the government&rsquo;s projects
for the reorganization of society, and imposing, in the latter,
an intolerable burden on the resources of the treasury. The
government thought that the time had come, and that its
own strength sufficed, to substitute compulsion for persuasion.
The financial measure&mdash;which was contrived so as to affect the
smallest pension-holders least injuriously&mdash;evoked no complaint.
The samurai remained faithful to the creed which forbade them
to be concerned about money. But the veto against sword-wearing
overtaxed the patience of the extreme Conservatives.
It seemed to them that all the most honoured traditions of their
country were being ruthlessly sacrificed on the altar of alien
innovations. Armed protests ensued. A few score of samurai,
equipping themselves with the hauberks and weapons of old
times, fell upon the garrison of a castle, killed or wounded some
300, and then, retiring to an adjacent mountain, died by their
own hands. Their example found imitators in two other places,
and finally the Satsuma samurai rose in arms under Saig&#333;.</p>

<p>This was an insurrection very different in dimensions and
motives from the outbreaks that had preceded it. During four
years the preparations of the Satsuma men had been
unremitting. They were equipped with rifles and
<span class="sidenote">Satsuma Insurrection.</span>
cannon; they numbered some 30,000; they were all of
the military class, and in addition to high training in western
tactics and in the use of modern arms of precision, they knew
how to wield that formidable weapon, the Japanese sword,
of which their opponents were for the most part ignorant.
Ostensibly their object was to restore the samurai to their old
supremacy, and to secure for them all the posts in the army, the
navy and the administration. But although they doubtless
entertained that intention, it was put forward mainly with the
hope of winning the co-operation of the military class throughout
the empire. The real purpose of the revolt was to secure the
governing power for Satsuma. A bitter struggle ensued.
Beginning on the 29th of January 1877, it was brought to a close
on the 24th of September by the death, voluntary or in battle,
of all the rebel leaders. During that period the number of men
engaged on the government&rsquo;s side had been 66,000 and the
number on the side of the rebels 40,000, out of which total the
killed and wounded aggregated 35,000, or 33% of the whole.
Had the government&rsquo;s troops been finally defeated, there can be
no doubt that the samurai&rsquo;s exclusive title to man and direct
the army and navy would have been re-established, and Japan
would have found herself permanently saddled with a military
class, heavily burdening her finances, seriously impeding her
progress towards constitutional government, and perpetuating
all the abuses incidental to a policy in which the power of the
sword rests entirely in the hands of one section of the people.
The nation scarcely appreciated the great issues that were at
stake. It found more interest in the struggle as furnishing a
conclusive test of the efficiency of the new military system compared
with the old. The army sent to quell the insurrection
consisted of recruits drawn indiscriminately from every class of
the people. Viewed in the light of history, it was an army of
commoners, deficient in the fighting instinct, and traditionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
demoralized for all purposes of resistance to the military class.
The Satsuma insurgents, on the contrary, represented the flower
of the samurai, long trained for this very struggle, and led by
men whom the nation regarded as its bravest captains. The
result dispelled all doubts about the fighting quality of the people
at large.</p>

<p>Concurrently with these events the government diligently
endeavoured to equip the country with all the paraphernalia of
Occidental civilization. It is easy to understand that
the master-minds of the era, who had planned and
<span class="sidenote">Steps of Progress.</span>
carried out the Restoration, continued to take the lead
in all paths of progress. Their intellectual superiority entitled
them to act as guides; they had enjoyed exceptional opportunities
of acquiring enlightenment by visits to Europe and America,
and the Japanese people had not yet lost the habit of looking to
officialdom for every initiative. But the spectacle thus presented
to foreign onlookers was not altogether without disquieting
suggestions. The government&rsquo;s reforms seemed to
outstrip the nation&rsquo;s readiness for them, and the results wore
an air of some artificiality and confusion. Englishmen were
employed to superintend the building of railways, the erection
of telegraphs, the construction of lighthouses and the organization
of a navy. To Frenchmen was entrusted the work of recasting
the laws and training the army in strategy and tactics.
Educational affairs, the organization of a postal service, the
improvement of agriculture and the work of colonization were
supervised by Americans. The teaching of medical science, the
compilation of a commercial code, the elaboration of a system
of local government, and ultimately the training of military
officers were assigned to Germans. For instruction in sculpture
and painting Italians were engaged. Was it possible that so
many novelties should be successfully assimilated, or that the
nation should adapt itself to systems planned by a motley band
of aliens who knew nothing of its character and customs?
These questions did not trouble the Japanese nearly so much as
they troubled strangers. The truth is that conservatism was
not really required to make the great sacrifices suggested by
appearances. Among all the innovations of the era the only
one that a Japanese could not lay aside at will was the new
fashion of dressing the hair. He abandoned the <i>queue</i> irrevocably.
But for the rest he lived a dual life. During hours of
duty he wore a fine uniform, shaped and decorated in foreign
style. But so soon as he stepped out of office or off parade,
he reverted to his own comfortable and picturesque costume.
Handsome houses were built and furnished according to Western
models. But each had an annex where alcoves, verandas,
matted floors and paper sliding doors continued to do traditional
duty. Beefsteaks, beer, &ldquo;grape-wine,&rdquo; knives and forks came
into use on occasion. But rice-bowls and chopsticks held their
everyday place as of old. In a word, though the Japanese
adopted every convenient and serviceable attribute of foreign
civilization, such as railways, steamships, telegraphs, post-offices,
banks and machinery of all kinds; though they accepted
Occidental sciences, and, to a large extent, Occidental philosophies;
though they recognized the superiority of European
jurisprudence and set themselves to bring their laws into accord
with it, they nevertheless preserved the essentials of their own
mode of life and never lost their individuality. A remarkable
spirit of liberalism and a fine eclectic instinct were needed for
the part they acted, but they did no radical violence to their own
traditions, creeds and conventions. There was indeed a certain
element of incongruity and even grotesqueness in the nation&rsquo;s
doings. Old people cannot fit their feet to new roads without
some clumsiness. The Japanese had grown very old in their
special paths, and their novel departure was occasionally disfigured
by solecisms. The refined taste that guided them unerringly
in all the affairs of life as they had been accustomed to
live it, seemed to fail them signally when they emerged into an
alien atmosphere. They have given their proofs, however. It
is now seen that the apparently excessive rapidity of their progress
did not overtax their capacities; that they have emerged
safely from their destructive era and carried their constructive
career within reach of certain success, and that while they have
still to develop some of the traits of their new civilization, there
is no prospect whatever of its proving ultimately unsuited to
them.</p>

<p>After the Satsuma rebellion, nothing disturbed the even tenor
of Japan&rsquo;s domestic politics except an attempt on the part of
some of her people to force the growth of parliamentary
government. It is evident that the united
<span class="sidenote">Development of Representative Government.</span>
effort made by the fiefs to overthrow the system
of dual government and wrest the administrative
power from the sh&#333;gun could have only one logical
outcome: the combined exercise of the recovered
power by those who had been instrumental in recovering it.
That was the meaning of the oath taken by the emperor at the
Restoration, when the youthful sovereign was made to say
that wise counsels should be widely sought, and all things
determined by public discussion. But the framers of the
oath had the samurai alone in view. Into their consideration
the common people&mdash;farmers, mechanics, tradesmen&mdash;did
not enter at all, nor had the common people themselves
any idea of advancing a claim to be considered. A
voice in the administration would have been to them an embarrassing
rather than a pleasing privilege. Thus the first deliberative
assembly was composed of nobles and samurai only. A
mere debating club without any legislative authority, it was
permanently dissolved after two sessions. Possibly the problem
of a parliament might have been long postponed after that
fiasco, had it not found an ardent advocate in Itagaki Taisuke
(afterwards Count Itagaki). A Tosa samurai conspicuous as a
leader of the restoration movement, Itagaki was among the advocates
of recourse to strong measures against Korea in 1873, and
his failure to carry his point, supplemented by a belief that a
large section of public opinion would have supported him had
there been any machinery for appealing to it, gave fresh impetus
to his faith in constitutional government. Resigning office on
account of the Korean question, he became the nucleus of
agitation in favour of a parliamentary system, and under his
banner were enrolled not only discontented samurai but also
many of the young men who, returning from direct observation
of the working of constitutional systems in Europe or America,
and failing to obtain official posts in Japan, attributed their
failure to the oligarchical form of their country&rsquo;s polity. Thus
in the interval <span class="correction" title="amended from betweeen">between</span> 1873 and 1877 there were two centres of
disturbance in Japan: one in Satsuma, where Saig&#333; figured
as leader; the other in Tosa, under Itagaki&rsquo;s guidance. When
the Satsuma men appealed to arms in 1877, a widespread apprehension
prevailed lest the Tosa politicians should throw in their
lot with the insurgents. Such a fear had its origin in failure to
understand the object of the one side or to appreciate the sincerity
of the other. Saig&#333; and his adherents fought to substitute
a Satsuma clique for the oligarchy already in power.
Itagaki and his followers struggled for constitutional institutions.
The two could not have anything in common. There was consequently
no coalition. But the Tosa agitators did not neglect
to make capital out of the embarrassment caused by the Satsuma
rebellion. While the struggle was at its height, they addressed
to the government a memorial, charging the administration with
oppressive measures to restrain the voice of public opinion,
with usurpation of power to the exclusion of the nation at large,
and with levelling downwards instead of upwards, since the
samurai had been reduced to the rank of commoners, whereas
the commoners should have been educated up to the standard
of the samurai. This memorial asked for a representative
assembly and talked of popular rights. But since the document
admitted that the people were uneducated, it is plain that there
cannot have been any serious idea of giving them a share in the
administration. In fact, the Tosa Liberals were not really contending
for popular representation in the full sense of the term.
What they wanted was the creation of some machinery for
securing to the samurai at large a voice in the management of
state affairs. They chafed against the fact that, whereas the
efforts and sacrifices demanded by the Restoration had fallen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
equally on the whole military class, the official prizes under the
new system were monopolized by a small coterie of men belonging
to the four principal clans. It is on record that Itagaki would
have been content originally with an assembly consisting half
of officials, half of non-official samurai, and not including any
popular element whatever.</p>

<p>But the government did not believe that the time had come
even for a measure such as the Tosa Liberals advocated. The
statesmen in power conceived that the nation must be educated
up to constitutional standards, and that the first step should be
to provide an official model. Accordingly, in 1874, arrangements
were made for periodically convening an assembly of
prefectural governors, in order that they might act as channels
of communication between the central authorities and the
provincial population, and mutually exchange ideas as to the
safest and most effective methods of encouraging progress within
the limits of their jurisdictions. This was intended to be the
embryo of representative institutions. But the governors,
being officials appointed by the cabinet, did not bear in any sense
the character of popular nominees, nor could it even be said that
they reflected the public feeling of the districts they administered,
for their habitual and natural tendency was to try, by
means of heroic object lessons, to win the people&rsquo;s allegiance to
the government&rsquo;s progressive policy, rather than to convince
the government of the danger of overstepping the people&rsquo;s
capacities.</p>

<p>These conventions of local officials had no legislative power
whatever. The foundations of a body for discharging that
function were laid in 1875, when a senate (<i>genro-in</i>) was organized.
It consisted of official nominees, and its duty was to discuss and
revise all laws and ordinances prior to their promulgation. It
is to be noted, however, that expediency not less than a spirit
of progress presided at the creation of the senate. Into its ranks
were drafted a number of men for whom no places could be
found in the executive, and who, without some official employment,
would have been drawn into the current of disaffection.
From that point of view the senate soon came to be regarded as a
kind of hospital for administrative invalids, but undoubtedly
its discharge of quasi-legislative functions proved suggestive,
useful and instructive.</p>

<p>The second meeting of the provincial governors had just been
prorogued when, in the spring of 1878, the great minister, Okubo
Toshimitsu, was assassinated. Okubo, uniformly
ready to bear the heaviest burden of responsibility
<span class="sidenote">Assassination of Okubo.</span>
in every political complication, had stood prominently
before the nation as Saig&#333;&rsquo;s opponent. He fell under the
swords of Saig&#333;&rsquo;s sympathizers. They immediately surrendered
themselves to justice, having taken previous care to circulate
a statement of motives, which showed that they ranked the
government&rsquo;s failure to establish representative institutions as a
sin scarcely less heinous than its alleged abuses of power. Well-informed
followers of Saig&#333; could never have been sincere
believers in representative institutions. These men belonged to
a province far removed from the scene of Saig&#333;&rsquo;s desperate
struggle. But the broad fact that they had sealed with their
life-blood an appeal for a political change indicated the existence
of a strong public conviction which would derive further
strength from their act. The Japanese are essentially a brave
people. Throughout the troublous events that preceded and
followed the Restoration, it is not possible to point to one man
whose obedience to duty or conviction was visibly weakened
by prospects of personal peril. Okubo&rsquo;s assassination did not
alarm any of his colleagues; but they understood its suggestiveness,
and hastened to give effect to a previously formed resolve.</p>

<p>Two months after Okubo&rsquo;s death, an edict announced that
elective assemblies should forthwith be established in various
prefectures and cities. These assemblies were to consist
of members having a high property qualification,
<span class="sidenote">Local Government.</span>
elected by voters having one-half of that qualification;
the voting to be by signed ballot, and the session to last for
one month in the spring of each year. As to their functions, they
were to determine the method of levying and spending local
taxes, subject to approval by the minister of state for home
affairs; to scrutinize the accounts for the previous year, and, if
necessary, to present petitions to the central government.
Thus the foundations of genuine representative institutions were
laid. It is true that legislative power was not vested in the
local assemblies, but in all other important respects they discharged
parliamentary duties. Their history need not be related
at any length. Sometimes they came into violent collision with
the governor of the prefecture, and unsightly struggles resulted.
The governors were disposed to advocate public works which
the people considered extravagant; and further, as years went
by, and as political organizations grew stronger, there was found
in each assembly a group of men ready to oppose the governor
simply because of his official status. But on the whole the
system worked well. The local assemblies served as training
schools for the future parliament, and their members showed
devotion to public duty as well as considerable aptitude for
debate.</p>

<p>This was not what Itagaki and his followers wanted. Their
purpose was to overthrow the clique of clansmen who, holding
the reins of administrative power, monopolized the
prizes of officialdom. Towards the consummation
<span class="sidenote">The Liberal Party.</span>
of such an aim the local assemblies helped little. Itagaki redoubled
his agitation. He organized his fellow-thinkers into
an association called <i>jiy&#363;t&#333;</i> (Liberals), the first political party in
Japan, to whose ranks there very soon gravitated several men
who had been in office and resented the loss of it; many that had
never been in office and desired to be; and a still greater number
who sincerely believed in the principles of political liberty, but
had not yet considered the possibility of immediately adapting
such principles to Japan&rsquo;s case. It was in the nature of things
that an association of this kind, professing such doctrines,
should present a picturesque aspect to the public, and that its
collisions with the authorities should invite popular sympathy.
Nor were collisions infrequent. For the government, arguing
that if the nation was not ready for representative institutions,
neither was it ready for full freedom of speech or of public
meeting, legislated consistently with that theory, and entrusted
to the police large powers of <span class="correction" title="amended from conrol">control</span> over the press and the platform.
The exercise of these powers often created situations in
which the Liberals were able to pose as victims of official tyranny,
so that they grew in popularity and the contagion of political
agitation spread.</p>

<p>Three years later (1881) another split occurred in the ranks
of the ruling oligarchy. Okuma Shigenobu (afterwards Count
Okuma) seceded from the administration, and was
followed by a number of able men who had owed
<span class="sidenote">The Progressist Party.</span>
their appointments to his patronage, or who, during
his tenure of office as minister of finance, had passed under
the influence of his powerful personality. If Itagaki be
called the Rousseau of Japan, Okuma may be regarded as the
Peel. To remarkable financial ability and a lucid, vigorous
judgment he added the faculty of placing himself on the crest
of any wave which a genuine <i>aura popularis</i> had begun to swell.
He, too, inscribed on his banner of revolt against the oligarchy
the motto &ldquo;constitutional government,&rdquo; and it might have been
expected that his followers would join hands with those of
Itagaki, since the avowed political purpose of both was identical.
They did nothing of the kind. Okuma organized an independent
party, calling themselves Progressists (<i>shimpot&#333;</i>), who
not only stood aloof from the Liberals but even assumed an
attitude hostile to them. This fact is eloquent. It shows that
Japan&rsquo;s first political parties were grouped, not about principles,
but about persons. Hence an inevitable lack of cohesion among
their elements and a constant tendency to break up into caves
and coteries. These are the characteristics that render the story
of political evolution in Japan so perplexing to a foreign student.
He looks for differences of platform and finds none. Just as a
true Liberal must be a Progressist, and a true Progressist a Liberal,
so, though each may cast his profession of faith in a mould of
different phrases, the ultimate shape must be the same. The
mainsprings of early political agitation in Japan were personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
grievances and a desire to wrest the administrative power from
the hands of the statesmen who had held it so long as to overtax
the patience of their rivals. He that searches for profound
moral or ethical bases will be disappointed. There were no
Conservatives. Society was permeated with the spirit of progress.
In a comparative sense the epithet &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; might have
been applied to the statesmen who proposed to defer parliamentary
institutions until the people, as distinguished from the
former samurai, had been in some measure prepared for such an
innovation. But since these very statesmen were the guiding
spirits of the whole Meiji revolution, it was plain that their
convictions must be radical, and that, unless they did violence
to their record, they must finally lead the country to representative
institutions, the logical sequel of their own reforms.</p>

<p>Okubo&rsquo;s assassination had been followed, in 1878, by an edict
announcing the establishment of local assemblies. Okuma&rsquo;s
secession in 1881 was followed by an edict announcing that a
national assembly would be convened in 1891.</p>

<p>The political parties, having now virtually attained their
object, might have been expected to desist from further agitation.
But they had another task to perform&mdash;that
of disseminating anti-official prejudices among
<span class="sidenote">Anti-Government Agitation.</span>
the future electors. They worked diligently, and
they had an undisputed field, for no one was put
forward to champion the government&rsquo;s cause. The campaign
was not always conducted on lawful lines. There were plots to
assassinate ministers; there was an attempt to employ dynamite,
and there was a scheme to foment an insurrection in Korea.
On the other hand, dispersals of political meetings by order of
police inspectors, and suspension or suppression of newspapers
by the unchallengeable verdict of a minister for home affairs,
were common occurrences. The breach widened steadily.
It is true that Okuma rejoined the cabinet for a time in 1887,
but he retired again in circumstances that aggravated his party&rsquo;s
hostility to officialdom. In short, during the ten years immediately
prior to the opening of the first parliament, an anti-government
propaganda was incessantly preached from the
platform and in the press.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the statesmen in power resolutely pursued their
path of progressive reform. They codified the civil and penal
laws, remodelling them on Western bases; they brought a vast
number of affairs within the scope of minute regulations; they
rescued the finances from confusion and restored them to a sound
condition; they recast the whole framework of local government;
they organized a great national bank, and established a network
of subordinate institutions throughout the country; they
pushed on the work of railway construction, and successfully
enlisted private enterprise in its cause; they steadily extended
the postal and telegraphic services; they economized public
expenditures so that the state&rsquo;s income always exceeded its
outlays; they laid the foundations of a strong mercantile marine;
they instituted a system of postal savings-banks; they undertook
large schemes of harbour improvement and road-making;
they planned and put into operation an extensive programme
of riparian improvement; they made civil service appointments
depend on competitive examination; they sent numbers of
students to Europe and America to complete their studies; and
by tactful, persevering diplomacy they gradually introduced
a new tone into the empire&rsquo;s relations with foreign powers.
Japan&rsquo;s affairs were never better administered.</p>

<p>In 1890 the Constitution was promulgated. Imposing ceremonies
marked the event. All the nation&rsquo;s notables were
summoned to the palace to witness the delivery
of the important document by the sovereign to the
<span class="sidenote">The Constitution of 1890.</span>
prime minister; salvos of artillery were fired; the
cities were illuminated, and the people kept holiday. Marquis
(afterwards Prince) It&#333; directed the framing of the Constitution.
He had visited the Occident for the purpose of investigating
the development of parliamentary institutions and studying
their practical working. His name is connected with nearly
every great work of constructive statesmanship in the history of
new Japan, and perhaps the crown of his legislative career was
the drafting of the Constitution, to which the Japanese people
point proudly as the only charter of the kind voluntarily given
by a sovereign to his subjects. In other countries such concessions
were always the outcome of long struggles between ruler
and ruled. In Japan the emperor freely divested himself of a
portion of his prerogatives and transferred them to the people.
That view of the case, as may be seen from the story told above,
is not untinged with romance; but in a general sense it is true.</p>

<p>No incident in Japan&rsquo;s modern career seemed more hazardous
than this sudden plunge into parliamentary institutions.
There had been some preparation. Provincial assemblies
had partially familiarized the people with
<span class="sidenote">Working of the System.</span>
the methods of deliberative bodies. But provincial
assemblies were at best petty arenas&mdash;places where the
making or mending of roads, and the policing and sanitation of
villages came up for discussion, and where political parties
exercised no legislative function nor found any opportunity to
attack the government or to debate problems of national interest.
Thus the convening of a diet and the sudden transfer of financial
and legislative authority from the throne and its entourage of
tried statesmen to the hands of men whose qualifications for
public life rested on the verdict of electors, themselves apparently
devoid of all light to guide their choice&mdash;this sweeping innovation
seemed likely to tax severely, if not to overtax completely, the
progressive capacities of the nation. What enhanced the interest
of the situation was that the oligarchs who held the administrative
power had taken no pains to win a following in the
political field. Knowing that the opening of the diet would be
a veritable letting loose of the dogs of war, an unmuzzling of the
agitators whose mouths had hitherto been partly closed by legal
restrictions upon free speech, but who would now enjoy complete
immunity within the walls of the assembly whatever the nature
of their utterances&mdash;foreseeing all this, the statesmen of the day
nevertheless stood severely aloof from alliances of every kind,
and discharged their administrative functions with apparent
indifference to the changes that popular representation could not
fail to induce. This somewhat inexplicable display of unconcern
became partially intelligible when the constitution was promulgated,
for it then appeared that the cabinet&rsquo;s tenure of office was
to depend solely on the emperor&rsquo;s will; that ministers were to
take their mandate from the Throne, not from parliament.
This fact was merely an outcome of the theory underlying every
part of the Japanese polity. Laws might be redrafted, institutions
remodelled, systems recast, but amid all changes and
mutations one steady point must be carefully preserved, the
Throne. The makers of new Japan understood that so long as
the sanctity and inviolability of the imperial prerogatives could
be preserved, the nation would be held by a strong anchor from
drifting into dangerous waters. They laboured under no misapprehension
about the inevitable issue of their work in framing
the constitution. They knew very well that party cabinets are
an essential outcome of representative institutions, and that to
some kind of party cabinet Japan must come. But they regarded
the Imperial mandate as a conservative safeguard, pending
the organization and education of parties competent to form
cabinets. Such parties did not yet exist, and until they came
into unequivocal existence, the Restoration statesmen, who had
so successfully managed the affairs of the nation during a quarter
of a century, resolved that the steady point furnished by the
throne must not be abandoned.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the agitators found here a new platform.
They had obtained a constitution and a diet, but they had not
obtained an instrument for pulling down the &ldquo;clan&rdquo; administrators,
since these stood secure from attack under the aegis
of the sovereign&rsquo;s mandate. They dared not raise their voices
against the unfettered exercise of the mikado&rsquo;s prerogative.
The nation, loyal to the core, would not have suffered such a
protest, nor could the agitators themselves have found heart
to formulate it. But they could read their own interpretation
into the text of the Constitution, and they could demonstrate
practically that a cabinet not acknowledging responsibility to the
legislature was virtually impotent for law-making purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span></p>

<p>These are the broad outlines of the contest that began in the
first session of the Diet and continued for several years. It is unnecessary
to speak of the special points of controversy.
Just as the political parties had been formed on the
<span class="sidenote">The Diet and the Government.</span>
lines of persons, not principles, so the opposition
in the Diet was directed against men, not measures.
The struggle presented varying aspects at different times, but
the fundamental question at issue never changed. Obstruction
was the weapon of the political parties. They sought to render
legislation and finance impossible for any ministry that refused
to take its mandate from the majority in the lower house, and
they imparted an air of respectability and even patriotism to
their destructive campaign by making &ldquo;anti-clannism&rdquo; their
war-cry, and industriously fostering the idea that the struggle
lay between administration guided by public opinion and administration
controlled by a clique of clansmen who separated the
throne from the nation. Had not the House of Peers stood
stanchly by the government throughout this contest, it is
possible that the nation might have suffered severely from the
rashness of the political parties.</p>

<p>There was something melancholy in the spectacle. The Restoration
statesmen were the men who had made Modern Japan;
the men who had raised her, in the face of immense obstacles,
from the position of an insignificant Oriental state to that of a
formidable unit in the comity of nations; the men, finally,
who had given to her a constitution and representative institutions.
Yet these same men were now fiercely attacked by the
arms which they had themselves nerved; were held up to public
obloquy as self-seeking usurpers, and were declared to be impeding
the people&rsquo;s constitutional route to administrative privileges,
when in reality they were only holding the breach until
the people should be able to march into the citadel with some
show of orderly and competent organization. That there was
no corruption, no abuse of position, is not to be pretended; but
on the whole the conservatism of the clan statesmen had only
one object&mdash;to provide that the newly constructed representative
machine should not be set working until its parts were duly
adjusted and brought into proper gear. On both sides the
leaders understood the situation accurately. The heads of the
parties, while publicly clamouring for parliamentary cabinets,
privately confessed that they were not yet prepared to assume
administrative responsibilities;<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and the so-called &ldquo;clan statesmen,&rdquo;
while refusing before the world to accept the Diet&rsquo;s
mandates, admitted within official circles that the question was
one of time only. The situation did not undergo any marked
change until, the country becoming engaged in war with China
(1894-95), domestic squabbles were forgotten in the presence of
foreign danger. From that time an era of coalition commenced.
Both the political parties joined hands to vote funds for the
prosecution of the campaign, and one of them, the Liberals,
subsequently gave support to a cabinet under the presidency of
Marquis It&#333;, the purpose of the union being to carry through the
diet an extensive scheme of enlarged armaments and public
works planned in the sequel of the war. The Progressists, however,
remained implacable, continuing their opposition to the
thing called bureaucracy quite irrespective of its measures.</p>

<p>The next phase (1898) was a fusion of the two parties into one
large organization which adopted the name &ldquo;Constitutional
Party&rdquo; (<i>kensei-t&#333;</i>). By this union the chief obstacles
to parliamentary cabinets were removed.
<span class="sidenote">Fusion of the Two Parties.</span>
Not only did the Constitutionalists command a
large majority in the lower house, but also they possessed a
sufficiency of men who, although lacking ministerial experience,
might still advance a reasonable title to be entrusted with portfolios.
Immediately the emperor, acting on the advice of
Marquis It&#333;, invited Counts Okuma and Itagaki to form a
cabinet. It was essentially a trial. The party politicians
were required to demonstrate in practice the justice of the claim
they had been so long asserting in theory. They had worked
in combination for the destructive purpose of pulling down the
so-called &ldquo;clan statesmen&rdquo;; they had now to show whether
they could work in combination for the constructive purposes
of administration. Their heads, Counts Okuma and Itagaki,
accepted the Imperial mandate, and the nation watched the
result. There was no need to wait long. In less than six
months these new links snapped under the tension of old
enmities, and the coalition split up once more into its original
elements. It had demonstrated that the sweets of power, which
the &ldquo;clan statesmen&rdquo; had been so vehemently accused of coveting,
possessed even greater attractions for their accusers. The
issue of the experiment was such a palpable fiasco that it effectually
rehabilitated the &ldquo;clan statesmen,&rdquo; and finally proved,
what had indeed been long evident to every close observer, that
without the assistance of those statesmen no political party
could hold office successfully.</p>

<p>Thenceforth it became the unique aim of Liberals and Progressists
alike to join hands permanently with the men towards
whom they had once displayed such implacable
hostility. Prince It&#333;, the leader of the so-called
<span class="sidenote">Enrolment of the Clan Statesmen in Political Associations.</span>
&ldquo;elder statesmen,&rdquo; received special solicitations, for
it was plain that he would bring to any political
party an overwhelming access of strength alike in
his own person and in the number of friends and
disciples certain to follow him. But Prince It&#333; declined to
be absorbed into any existing party, or to adopt the principle
of parliamentary cabinets. He would consent to form a new
association, but it must consist of men sufficiently disciplined
to obey him implicitly, and sufficiently docile to accept their
programme from his hand. The Liberals agreed to these terms.
They dissolved their party (August 1900) and enrolled themselves
in the ranks of a new organization, which did not even call
itself a party, its designation being <i>rikken seiy&#363;-kai</i> (association
of friends of the constitution), and which had for the cardinal
plank in its platform a declaration of ministerial irresponsibility
to the Diet. A singular page was thus added to the story of
Japanese political development; for not merely did the Liberals
enlist under the banner of the statesmen whom for twenty
years they had fought to overthrow, but they also tacitly
consented to erase from their profession of faith its essential
article, parliamentary cabinets, and, by resigning that article
to the Progressists, created for the first time an opposition with
a solid and intelligible platform. Nevertheless the seiy&#363;-kai
grew steadily in strength whereas the number of its opponents
declined correspondingly. At the general elections in May
1908 the former secured 195 seats, the four sections of the
opposition winning only 184. Thus for the first time in Japanese
parliamentary history a majority of the lower chamber found
themselves marching under the same banner. Moreover,
the four sections of the opposition were independently organized
and differed nearly as much from one another as they all differed
from the seiy&#363;-kai. Their impotence to make head against the
solid phalanx of the latter was thus conspicuous, especially
during the 1908-1909 session of the Diet. Much talk then began
to be heard about the necessity of coalition, and that this talk
will materialize eventually cannot be doubted. Reduction of
armaments, abolition of taxes specially imposed for belligerent
purposes, and the substitution of a strictly constitutional
system for the existing bureaucracy&mdash;these objects constitute
a sufficiently solid platform, and nothing is wanted except that
a body of proved administrators should join the opposition
in occupying it. There were in 1909 no signs, however, that
any such defection from the ranks of officialdom would take
place. Deference is paid to public opinions inasmuch as even a
seiy&#363;-kai ministry will not remain in office after its popularity
has begun to show signs of waning. But no deference is paid
to the doctrine of party cabinets. Prince It&#333; did not continue
to lead the seiy&#363;-kai for more than three years. In July 1903
he delegated that function to Marquis Saionji, representative
of one of the very oldest families of the court nobility and a
personal friend of the emperor, as also was Prince It&#333;. The
Imperial stamp is thus vicariously set upon the principle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
political combinations for the better practical conduct of
parliamentary business, but that the seiy&#363;-kai, founded by
Prince It&#333; and led by Marquis Saionji, should ever hold office
in defiance of the sovereign&rsquo;s mandate is unthinkable. Constitutional
institutions in Japan are therefore developing along
lines entirely without precedent. The storm and stress of early
parliamentary days have given place to comparative calm.
During the first twelve sessions of the Diet, extending over 8 years,
there were five dissolutions of the lower house. During the next
thirteen sessions, extending over 11 years, there were two
dissolutions. During the first 8 years of the Diet&rsquo;s existence there
were six changes of cabinet; during the next 11 years there were
five changes. Another healthy sign was that men of affairs
were beginning to realize the importance of parliamentary
representation. At first the constituencies were contested
almost entirely by professional politicians, barristers and
journalists. In 1909 there was a solid body (the <i>boshin</i> club)
of business men commanding nearly 50 votes in the lower
house; and as the upper chamber included 45 representatives
of the highest tax-payers, the interests of commerce and
industry were intelligently debated.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">X.&mdash;The Claim of Japan: by a Japanese Statesman<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>It has been said that it is impossible for an Occidental to
understand the Oriental, and vice versa; but, admitting that
the mutual understanding of two different races or peoples
is a difficult matter, why should Occidentals and Orientals
be thus set in opposition? No doubt, different peoples of
Europe understand each other better than they do the Asiatic;
but can Asiatic peoples understand each other better than they
can Europeans or than the Europeans can understand any of
them? Do Japanese understand Persians or even Indians
better than English or French? It is true perhaps that Japanese
can and do understand the Chinese better than Europeans;
but that is due not only to centuries of mutual intercourse,
but to the wonderful and peculiar fact that they have adopted
the old classical Chinese literature as their own, somewhat in the
way, but in a much greater degree, in which the European
nations have adopted the old Greek and Latin literatures.
What is here contended for is that the mutual understanding
of two peoples is not so much a matter of race, but of the knowledge
of each other&rsquo;s history, traditions, literature, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Japanese have, they think, suffered much from the
misunderstanding of their motives, feelings and ideas; what they
want is to be understood fully and to be known for what they
really are, be it good or bad. They desire, above all, not to be
lumped as Oriental, but to be known and judged on their own
account. In the latter half of the 19th century, in fact up to
the Chinese War, it irritated Japanese travelling abroad more
than anything else to be taken for Chinese. Then, after the
Chinese War, the alarm about Japan leading Eastern Asia
to make a general attack upon Europe&mdash;the so-called Yellow
Peril&mdash;seemed so ridiculous to the Japanese that the bad effects of
such wild talk were not quite appreciated by them. The aim of
the Japanese nation, ever since, at the time of the Restoration
(1868), they laid aside definitively all ideas of seclusion and
entered into the comity of nations, has been that they should
rise above the level of the Eastern peoples to an equality with
the Western and should be in the foremost rank of the brotherhood
of nations; it was not their ambition at all to be the
champion of the East against the West, but rather to beat
down the barriers between themselves and the West.</p>

<p>The intense pride of the Japanese in their nationality, their
patriotism and loyalty, arise from their history, for what other
nation can point to an Imperial family of one unbroken lineage
reigning over the land for twenty-five centuries? Is it not a
glorious tradition for a nation, that its emperor should be descended
directly from that grandson of &ldquo;the great heaven-illuminating
goddess,&rdquo; to whom she said, &ldquo;This land (Japan)
is the region over which my descendants shall be the lords.
Do thou, my august child, proceed thither and govern it. Go!
<i>The prosperity of thy dynasty shall be coeval with heaven and earth.</i>&rdquo;
Thus they call their country the land of <i>kami</i> (ancient gods of
tradition). With this spirit, in the old days when China held
the hegemony of the East, and all neighbouring peoples were
regarded as its tributaries, Japan alone, largely no doubt on
account of its insular position, held itself quite aloof; it set at
defiance the power of Kublai and routed utterly the combined
Chinese and Korean fleets with vast forces sent by him to conquer
Japan, this being the only occasion that Japan was threatened
with a foreign invasion.</p>

<p>With this spirit, as soon as they perceived the superiority of
the Western civilization, they set to work to introduce it into
their country, just as in the 7th and 8th centuries they had
adopted and adapted the Chinese civilization. In 1868, the first
year of the era of Meiji, the emperor swore solemnly the memorable
oath of five articles, setting forth the policy that was to be
and has been followed thereafter by the government. These
five articles were:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. Deliberative assemblies shall be established and all measures
of government shall be decided by public opinion.</p>

<p>2. All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying
out the plan of government.</p>

<p>3. Officials, civil and military, and all common people shall as
far as possible be allowed to fulfil their just desires so that there
may not be any discontent among them.</p>

<p>4. <i>Uncivilized customs of former times shall be broken through</i>, and
everything shall be based upon just and equitable principles of
heaven and earth (nature).</p>

<p>5. <i>Knowledge shall be sought for throughout the world</i>, so that the
welfare of the empire may be promoted.</p>

<p>&emsp; (Translation due to Prof. N. Hozumi of T&#333;ky&#333; Imp. Univ.)</p>
</div>

<p>It is interesting, as showing the continuity of the policy of the
empire, to place side by side with these articles the words of the
Imperial rescript issued in 1908, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;We are convinced that with the rapid and unceasing advance of
civilization, the East and West, mutually dependent and helping
each other, are bound by common interests. It is our sincere wish
to continue to enjoy for ever its benefits in common with other
powers by entering into closer and closer relations and strengthening
our friendship with them. Now in order to be able to move onward
along with the constant progress of the world and to share in the
blessings of civilization, it is obvious that we must develop our
internal resources; our nation, but recently emerged from an exhausting
war, must put forth increased activity in every branch
of administration. It therefore behoves our people to endeavour
with one mind, from the highest to the lowest, to pursue their
callings honestly and earnestly, to be industrious and thrifty, to
abide in faith and righteousness, to be simple and warm-hearted,
to put away ostentation and vanity and strive after the useful and
solid, to avoid idleness and indulgence, and to apply themselves
incessantly to strenuous and arduous tasks....&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The ambition of the Japanese people has been, as already
stated, to be recognized as an equal by the Great Powers. With
this object in view, they have spared no efforts to introduce what
they considered superior in the Western civilization, although it
may perhaps be doubted whether in their eagerness they have
always been wise. <i>They have always resented any discrimination
against them as an Asiatic people</i>, not merely protesting against
it, knowing that such would not avail much, but making every
endeavour to remove reasons or excuses for it. Formerly there
were troops stationed to guard several legations; foreign postal
service was not entirely in the hands of the Japanese government
for a long time; these and other indignities against the sovereignty
of the nation were gradually removed by proving that
they were not necessary. Then there was the question of the
extra-territorial jurisdiction; an embassy was sent to Europe
and America as early as 1871 with a view to the revision of
treaties in order to do away with this <i>imperium in imperio</i>, that
being the date originally fixed for the revision; the embassy,
however, failed in its object but was not altogether fruitless, for
it was then clearly seen that it would be necessary to revise
thoroughly the system of laws and entirely to reorganize the
law courts before Occidental nations could be induced to forgo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
this privilege. These measures were necessary in any case as
a consequence of the introduction of the Western methods and
ideas, but they were hastened by the fact of their being a necessary
preliminary to the revision of treaties. When the new code of
laws was brought before the Diet at its first session, and there
was a great opposition against it in the House of Peers on account
of its many defects and especially of its ignoring many established
usages, the chief argument in its favour, or at least one that had
a great influence with many who were unacquainted with technical
points, was that it was necessary for the revision of treaties
and that the defects, if any, could be afterwards amended at
leisure. These preparations on the part of the government,
however, took a long time, and in the meantime the whole nation,
or at least the more intelligent part of it, was chafing impatiently
under what was considered a national indignity. The United
States, by being the first to agree to its abandonment, although
this agreement was rendered nugatory by a conditional clause,
added to the stock of goodwill with which the Japanese have
always regarded the Americans on account of their attitude
towards them. When at last the consummation so long and
ardently desired was attained, great was the joy with which it
was greeted, for now it was felt that Japan was indeed on terms
of equality with Occidental nations. Great Britain, by being the
first to conclude the revised treaty&mdash;an act due to the remarkable
foresight of her statesmen in spite of the opposition of their
countrymen in Japan&mdash;did much to bring about the cordial
feeling of the Japanese towards the British, which made them
welcome with such enthusiasm the Anglo-Japanese alliance.
The importance of this last as a powerful instrument for the
preservation of peace in the extreme East has been, and always
will be, appreciated at its full value by the more intelligent and
thoughtful among the Japanese; but by the mass of the people
it was received with great acclamation, owing partly to the already
existing good feeling towards the British, but also in a large
measure because it was felt that the fact that Great Britain
should leave its &ldquo;splendid isolation&rdquo; to enter into this alliance
proclaimed in the clearest possible way that Japan had entered
on terms of full equality among the brotherhood of nations, and
that thenceforth there could be no ground for that discrimination
against them as an Asiatic nation which had been so galling to
the Japanese people.</p>

<p>There have been, and there still are being made, many charges
against the Japanese government and people. While admitting
that some of them may be founded on facts, it is permissible to
point out that traits and acts of a few individuals have often been
generalized to be the national characteristic or the result of a
fixed policy, while in many cases such charges are due to misunderstandings
arising from want of thorough knowledge of each
other&rsquo;s language, customs, usages, ideas, &amp;c. Take the principle
of &ldquo;the open door,&rdquo; for instance; the Japanese government has
been charged in several instances with acting contrary to it. It
is natural that where (as in China) competition is very keen
between men of different nationalities, individuals should sometimes
feel aggrieved and make complaints of unfairness against
the government of their competitors; it is also natural that people
at home should listen to and believe in those charges made
against the Japanese by their countrymen in the East, while
unfortunately the Japanese, being so far away and often unaware
of them, have not a ready means of vindicating themselves; but
subsequent investigations have always shown those charges to
be either groundless or due to misunderstandings, and it may be
asserted that in no case has the charge been substantiated that
the Japanese government has knowingly, deliberately, of <i>malice
prepense</i> been guilty of breach of faith in violating the principle
of &ldquo;the open door&rdquo; to which it has solemnly pledged itself. That
it has often been accused by the Japanese subjects of weakness
<i>vis-à-vis</i> foreign powers to the detriment of their interests, is
perhaps a good proof of its fairness.</p>

<p>The Japanese have often been charged with looseness of commercial
morality. This charge is harder to answer than the last,
for it cannot be denied that there have been many instances of
dishonesty on the part of Japanese tradesmen or employees; <i>tu
quoque</i> is never a valid argument, but there are black sheep everywhere,
and there were special reasons why foreigners should have
come in contact with many such in their dealings with the
Japanese. In days before the Restoration, merchants and
tradesmen were officially classed as the lowest of four classes,
the samurai, the farmers, the artisans and the merchants;
practically, however, rich merchants serving as bankers and
employers of others were held in high esteem, even by the samurai.
Yet it cannot be denied that the position of the last three was
low compared with that of the samurai; their education was not
so high, and although of course there was the same code of
morality for them all, there was no such high standard of honour
as was enjoined upon the samurai by the bushid&#333; or &ldquo;the way
of samurai.&rdquo; Now, when foreign trade was first opened, it was
naturally not firms with long-established credit and methods that
first ventured upon the new field of business&mdash;some few that did
failed owing to their want of experience&mdash;it was rather enterprising
and adventurous spirits with little capital or credit who
eagerly flocked to the newly opened ports to try their fortune.
It was not to be expected that all or most of those should
be very scrupulous in their dealings with the foreigners; the
majority of those adventurers failed, while a few of the abler men,
generally those who believed in and practised honesty as the
best policy, succeeded and came to occupy an honourable position
as business men. It is also asserted that foreigners, or at
least some of them, did not scruple to take unfair advantage of
the want of experience on the part of their Japanese customers
to impose upon them methods which they would not have
followed except in the East; it may be that such methods were
necessary or were deemed so in dealing with those adventurers,
but it is a fact that it afterwards took a long time and great effort
on the part of Japanese traders to break through some usages
and customs which were established in earlier days and which
they deemed derogatory to their credit or injurious to their interests.
Infringement of patent rights and fraudulent imitation
of trade-marks have with some truth also been charged against
the Japanese; about this it is to be remarked that although
the principles of morality cannot change, their applications may
be new; patents and trade-marks are something new to the
Japanese, and it takes time to teach that their infringement
should be regarded with the same moral censure as stealing.
The government has done everything to prevent such practices
by enacting and enforcing laws against them, and nowadays they
are not so common. Be that as it may, such a state of affairs
as that mentioned above is now passing away almost entirely;
commerce and trade are now regarded as highly honourable professions,
merchants and business men occupy the highest social
positions, several of them having been lately raised to the peerage,
and are as honourable a set of men as can be met anywhere. It
is however to be regretted that in introducing Western business
methods, it has not been quite possible to exclude some of their
evils, such as promotion of swindling companies, tampering with
members of legislature, and so forth.</p>

<p>The Japanese have also been considered in some quarters to
be a bellicose nation. No sooner was the war with Russia over
than they were said to be ready and eager to fight with the
United States. This is another misrepresentation arising from
want of proper knowledge of Japanese character and feelings.
Although it is true that within the quarter of a century preceding
1909 Japan was engaged in two sanguinary wars, not to mention
the Boxer affair, in which owing to her proximity to the scene
of the disturbances she had to take a prominent part, yet neither
of these was of her own seeking; in both cases she had to fight or
else submit to become a mere cipher in the world, if indeed she
could have preserved her existence as an independent state. The
Japanese, far from being a bellicose people, deliberately cut off
all intercourse with the outside world in order to avoid international
troubles, and remained absolutely secluded from the
world and at profound peace within their own territory for two
centuries and a half. Besides, the Japanese have always regarded
the Americans with a special goodwill, due no doubt to
the steady liberal attitude of the American government and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
people towards Japan and Japanese, and they look upon
the idea of war between Japan and the United States as
ridiculous.</p>

<p>Restrictions upon Japanese emigrants to the United States
and to Australia are irritating to the Japanese, because it is a
discrimination against them as belonging to the &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; race,
whereas it has been their ambition to raise themselves above the
level of the Eastern nations to an equality with the Western
nations, although they cannot change the colour of their skin.
When a Japanese even of the highest rank and standing has to
obtain a permit from an American immigrant officer before he can
enter American territory, is it not natural that he and his countrymen
should resent this discrimination as an indignity? But they
have too much good sense to think or even dream of going to
war upon such a matter; on the contrary, the Japanese government
agreed in 1908 to limit the number of emigrants in order
to avoid complications.</p>

<p>It may be repeated that it has ever been the ambition of the
Japanese people to take rank with the Great Powers of the world,
and to have a voice in the council of nations; they demand that
they shall not be discriminated against because of the colour of
their skin, but that they shall rather be judged by their deeds.
With this aim, they have made great efforts: where charges
brought against them have any foundation in fact, they have
endeavoured to make reforms; where they are false or due to
misunderstandings they have tried to live them down, trusting
to time for their vindication. They are willing to be judged by
the intelligent and impartial world: a fair field and no favour is
what they claim, and think they have a right to claim, from
the world.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAPANNING,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> the art of coating surfaces of metal, wood, &amp;c.,
with a variety of varnishes, which are dried and hardened on in
stoves or hot chambers. These drying processes constitute the
main distinguishing features of the art. The trade owes its
name to the fact that it is an imitation of the famous lacquering
of Japan (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Japan</a></span>: <i>Art</i>), which, however, is prepared with
entirely different materials and processes, and is in all respects
much more brilliant, durable and beautiful than any ordinary
japan work. Japanning is done in clear transparent varnishes,
in black and in body colours; but black japan is the most
characteristic and common style of work. The varnish for black
japan consists essentially of pure natural asphaltum with a proportion
of gum animé dissolved in linseed oil and thinned with
turpentine. In thin layers such a japan has a rich dark brown
colour; it only shows a brilliant black in thicker coatings. For
fine work, which has to be smoothed and polished, several coats
of black are applied in succession, each being separately dried in
the stove at a heat which may rise to about 300° F. Body
colours consist of a basis of transparent varnish mixed with the
special mineral paints of the desired colours or with bronze
powders. The transparent varnish used by japanners is a copal
varnish which contains less drying oil and more turpentine than
is contained in ordinary painters&rsquo; oil varnish. Japanning produces
a brilliant polished surface which is much more durable and
less easily affected by heat, moisture or other influences than any
ordinary painted and varnished work. It may be regarded as a
process intermediate between ordinary painting and enamelling.
It is very extensively applied in the finishing of ordinary iron-mongery
goods and domestic iron-work, deed boxes, clock dials
and papier-mâché articles. The process is also applied to blocks
of slate for making imitation of black and other marbles for
chimneypieces, &amp;c., and in a modified form is employed for
preparing enamelled, japan or patent leather.</p>

<p class="noind">This is probably an ancient oracle independent alike of the flood
story and the genealogical scheme in Gen. x. Shem is probably
Israel; Canaan, of course, the Canaanites; by analogy, Japheth
should be some third element of the population of Palestine&mdash;the
Philistines or the Phoenicians have been suggested. The sense
of the second line is doubtful, it may be &ldquo;let God dwell&rdquo; or &ldquo;let
Japheth dwell&rdquo;; on the latter view Japheth appears to be in
friendly alliance with Shem. The words might mean that
Japheth was an intruding invader, but this is not consonant with
the tone of the oracle. Possibly Japheth is only present in
Gen. ix. 20-27 through corruption of the text, Japheth may
be an accidental repetition of yapht &ldquo;may he enlarge,&rdquo; misread
as a proper name.</p>

<p>In Gen. x. Japheth is the northern and western division of the
nations; being perhaps used as a convenient title under which to
group the more remote peoples who were not thought of as standing
in ethnic or political connexion with Israel or Egypt. Thus
of his descendants, Gomer, Magog,<a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Tubal, Meshech, Ashkenaz,
Riphath and Togarmah are peoples who are located with more
or less certainty in N.E. Asia Minor, Armenia and the lands to
the N.E. of the Black Sea; Javan is the Ionians, used loosely for
the seafaring peoples of the West, including Tarshish (Tartessus
in Spain), Kittim (Cyprus), Rodanim<a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a> (Rhodes). There is no
certain identification of Tiras and Elishah.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The similarity of the name Japheth to the Titan Iapetos of Greek
mythology is probably a mere accident. A place Japheth is mentioned
in Judith ii. 25, but it is quite unknown.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAR,<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> a vessel of simple form, made of earthenware, glass, &amp;c.,

word came into English through Fr. <i>jarre</i> or Span, <i>jarra</i>, from
Arab, <i>jarrah</i>, the earthenware vessel of Eastern countries, used
to contain water, oil, wine, &amp;c. The simple electrical condenser
known as a <i>Leyden Jar</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) was so called because of the early
experiments made in the science of electricity at Leiden. In the
sense of a harsh vibrating sound, a sudden shock or vibrating
movement, hence dissension, quarrel or petty strife, &ldquo;jar&rdquo; is
onomatopoeic in origin; it is also seen in the name of the bird
night-jar (also known as the goat-sucker). In the expression
&ldquo;on the jar&rdquo; or &ldquo;ajar,&rdquo; of a door or window partly open, the
word is another form of <i>chare</i> or <i>char</i>, meaning turn or turning,
which survives in charwoman, one who works at a turn, a job

<p><span class="bold">JARGON,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> in its earliest use a term applied to the chirping and
twittering of birds, but since the 15th century mainly confined to
any language, spoken or written, which is either unintelligible
to the user or to the hearer. It is particularly applied by uninstructed
hearers or readers to the language full of technical
terminology used by scientific, philosophic and other writers.
The word is O. Fr., and Cotgrave defines it as &ldquo;gibridge
(gibberish), fustian language.&rdquo; It is cognate with Span. <i>gerigonza</i>,
and Ital. <i>gergo</i>, <i>gergone</i>, and probably related to the
onomatopoeic O. Fr. <i>jargouiller</i>, to chatter. The root is probably
seen in Lat. <i>garrire</i>, to chatter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JARGOON,<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> or Jargon (occasionally in old writings <i>jargounce</i>
and <i>jacounce</i>), a name applied by modern mineralogists to those
zircons which are fine enough to be cut as gem-stones, but are
not of the red colour which characterizes the hyacinth or jacinth.
The word is related to Arab <i>zargun</i> (zircon). Some of the finest
jargoons are green, others brown and yellow, whilst some are
colourless. The colourless jargoon may be obtained by heating
certain coloured stones. When zircon is heated it sometimes
changes in colour, or altogether loses it, and at the same time
usually increases in density and brilliancy. The so-called
Matura diamonds, formerly sent from Matara (or Matura), in
Ceylon, were decolorized zircons. The zircon has strong refractive
power, and its lustre is almost adamantine, but it lacks
the fire of the diamond. The specific gravity of zircon is subject
to considerable variation in different varieties; thus Sir A. H.
Church found the sp. gr. of a fine leaf-green jargoon to be as low
as 3.982, and that of a pure white jargoon as high as 4.705.
Jargoon and tourmaline, when cut as gems, are sometimes mistaken
for each other, but the sp. gr. is distinctive, since that of
tourmaline is only 3 to 3.2. Moreover, in tourmaline the dichroism
is strongly marked, whereas in jargoon it is remarkably
feeble. The refractive indices of jargoon are much higher than
those of tourmaline (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zircon</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JARRAH WOOD<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (an adaptation of the native name <i>Jerryhl</i>),
the product of a large tree (<i>Eucalyptus marginata</i>) found in
south-western Australia, where it is said to cover an area of
14,000 sq. m. The trees grow straight in the stem to a great size,
and yield squared timber up to 40 ft. length and 24 in. diameter.
The wood is very hard, heavy (sp. gr. 1.010) and close-grained,
with a mahogany-red colour, and sometimes sufficient &ldquo;figure&rdquo;
to render it suitable for cabinet-makers&rsquo; use. The timber
possesses several useful characteristics; and great expectations
were at first formed as to its value for ship-building and general
constructive purposes. These expectations have not, however,
been realized, and the exclusive possession of the tree has not
proved that source of wealth to western Australia which was at
one time expected. Its greatest merit for ship-building and
marine purposes is due to the fact that it resists, better than
any other timber, the attacks of the <i>Teredo navalis</i> and other
marine borers, and on land it is equally exempt, in tropical
countries, from the ravages of white ants. When felled with the
sap at its lowest point and well seasoned, the wood stands
exposure in the air, earth or sea remarkably well, on which
account it is in request for railway sleepers, telegraph poles and
piles in the British colonies and India. The wood, however,
frequently shows longitudinal blisters, or lacunae, filled with
resin, the same as may be observed in spruce fir timber; and
it is deficient in fibre, breaking with a short fracture under
comparatively moderate pressure. It has been classed at
Lloyds for ship-building purposes in line three, table A, of the
registry rules.</p>

removed under Edward the Confessor to Durham, it attracted

very largely to the enterprise of Sir Charles Mark Palmer (<i>q.v.</i>).
Jarrow Slake, a river bay, 1 m. long by ½ m. broad, contains

collection of the kind is now extant, nor is anything known of it.
Various speculations have been put forward as to the name: (1)
that it means the book of the upright, <i>i.e.</i> Israel or distinguished
Israelites, the root being the same as in Jeshurun; (2) that
Jashar (<span title="yashar">&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;</span>) is a transposition of shîr (<span title="shir">&#1513;&#1497;&#1512;</span>, song); (3) that it
should be pointed Yashir (<span title="yashir">&#1497;&#1513;&#1512;</span>, sing; cf. Exod. xv. 1) and was
so called after its first word. None of these is very convincing,
though support may be found for them all in the versions. The
Septuagint favours (1) by its rendering <span class="grk" title="epi bibliou tou euthous">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#949;&#8016;&#952;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>
in Samuel (it omits the words in Joshua); the Vulgate has <i>in
libro justorum</i> in both places; the Syriac in Samuel has <i>Ash&#299;r</i>,
which suggests a Hebrew reading <i>ha-sh&#299;r</i> (the song), and in
Joshua it translates &ldquo;book of praises.&rdquo; The Targum on both
passages has &ldquo;book of the law,&rdquo; an explanation which is followed
by the chief Jewish commentators, making the incidents
the fulfilment of passages in the Pentateuch. Since it contained
the lament of David (2 Sam. i. 18) it cannot have been
completed till after his time. If Wellhausen&rsquo;s restoration of
1 Kings viii. 12 be accepted (from Septuagint 1 Kings viii. 53,
<span class="grk" title="en bibliô tês ôdês">&#7952;&#957; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#8179; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8096;&#948;&#8134;&#962;</span>) where the reference is to the building
of the Temple, the book must have been growing in the time of
Solomon. The attempt of Donaldson<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> to reconstruct it is
largely subjective and uncritical.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In later times when it became customary to compose midrashic
works under well-known names, a book of Jashar naturally made
its appearance. It need hardly be remarked that this has nothing
whatever to do with the older book. It is an anonymous elaboration
in Hebrew of the early part of the biblical narrative, probably composed
in the 12th century. The fact that its legendary material
is drawn from Arabic sources, as well as from Talmud, Midrash
and later Jewish works, would seem to show that the writer lived in
Spain, or, according to others, in south Italy. The first edition
appeared at Venice in 1625, and it has been frequently printed
since. It was translated into English by (or for) M. M. Noah
(New York, 1840). A work called <i>The Book of ... Jasher, translated
... by Alcuin</i> (1751; 2nd ed., Bristol, 1829), has nothing to
do with this or with any Hebrew original, but is a mere fabrication
by the printer, Jacob Hive, who put it forward as the book
&ldquo;mentioned in Holy Scripture.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">JASMIN, JACQUES<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1798-1864), Provençal poet, was born at
Agen on the 6th of March 1798, his family name being Boé. His
father, who was a tailor, had a certain facility for making doggerel
verses, which he sang or recited at fairs and such-like popular
gatherings; and Jacques, who used generally to accompany him,
was thus early familiarized with the part which he afterwards so
successfully filled himself. When sixteen years of age he found
employment at a hairdresser&rsquo;s shop, and subsequently started
a similar business of his own on the Gravier at Agen. In 1825
he published his first volume of <i>Papillotos</i> (&ldquo;Curl Papers&rdquo;),
containing poems in French (a language he used with a certain
sense of restraint), and in the familiar Agen <i>patois</i>&mdash;the popular
speech of the working classes&mdash;in which he was to achieve all
his literary triumphs. Jasmin was the most famous forerunner
in Provençal literature (<i>q.v.</i>) of Mistral and the <i>Félibrige</i>. His
influence in rehabilitating, for literary purposes, his native dialect,
was particularly exercised in the public recitals of his poems to
which he devoted himself. His poetic gift, and his flexible voice
and action, fitted him admirably for this double rôle of troubadour
and jongleur. In 1835 he recited his &ldquo;Blind Girl of Castel-Cuillé&rdquo;
at Bordeaux, in 1836 at Toulouse; and he met with an
enthusiastic reception in both those important cities. Most of
his public recitations were given for benevolent purposes, the
proceeds being contributed by him to the restoration of the church
of Vergt and other good works. Four successive volumes of
<i>Papillotos</i> were published during his lifetime, and contained
amongst others the following remarkable poems, quoted in order:
&ldquo;The Charivari,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Recollections&rdquo; (supplemented after an
interval of many years), &ldquo;The Blind Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Françounetto,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Martha the Simple,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Twin Brothers.&rdquo; With the
exception of &ldquo;The Charivari,&rdquo; these are all touching pictures of
humble life&mdash;in most cases real episodes&mdash;carefully elaborated
by the poet till the graphic descriptions, full of light and colour,
and the admirably varied and melodious verse, seem too spontaneous
and easy to have cost an effort. Jasmin was not a prolific
writer, and, in spite of his impetuous nature, would work a long
time at one poem, striving to realize every feeling he wished to
describe, and give it its most lucid and natural expression. A
verse from his spirited poem, &ldquo;The Third of May,&rdquo; written in
honour of Henry IV., and published in the first volume of <i>Papillotos</i>,
is engraved on the base of the statue erected to that king
at Nérac. In 1852 Jasmin&rsquo;s works were crowned by the Académie
Française, and a pension was awarded him. The medal
struck on the occasion bore the inscription: <i>Au poëte moral et
populaire</i>. His title of &ldquo;Maistre ès Jeux&rdquo; is a distinction only
conferred by the academy of Toulouse on illustrious writers.
Pius IX. sent him the insignia of a knight of St Gregory the
Great, and he was made chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He
spent the latter years of his life on a small estate which he had
bought near Agen and named &ldquo;Papillotos,&rdquo; and which he
describes in <i>Ma Bigno</i> (&ldquo;My Vine&rdquo;). Though invited to represent
his native city, he refused to do so, preferring the pleasures
and leisure of a country life, and wisely judging that he was no
really eligible candidate for electoral honours. He died on the
4th of October 1864. His last poem, an answer to Renan, was
placed between his folded hands in his coffin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JASMINE,<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Jessamine</span>, botanically <i>Jasminum</i>, a genus of
shrubs or climbers constituting the principal part of the tribe
Jasminoideae of the natural order Oleaceae, and comprising
about 150 species, of which 40 or more occur in the gardens of
Britain. The plants of the genus are mostly natives of the
warmer regions of the Old World; there is one South American
species. The leaves are pinnate or ternate, or sometimes apparently
simple, consisting of one leaflet, articulated to the petiole.
The flowers, usually white or yellow, are arranged in terminal or
axillary panicles, and have a tubular 5- or 8-cleft calyx, a cylindrical
corolla-tube, with a spreading limb, two included stamens
and a two-celled ovary.</p>

<p>The name is derived from the Persian <i>yásmín</i>. Linnaeus
obtained a fancied etymology from <span class="grk" title="ia">&#7988;&#945;</span>, violets, and <span class="grk" title="osmê">&#8000;&#963;&#956;&#942;</span>, smell,
but the odour of its flowers bears no resemblance to that of the
violet. The common white jasmine, <i>Jasminum officinale</i>, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
of the best known and most highly esteemed of British hardy
ligneous climbers, is a native of northern India and Persia, introduced
about the middle of the 16th century. In the centre and
south of Europe it is thoroughly acclimatized. Although it
grows to the height of 12 and sometimes 20 ft., its stem is feeble
and requires support; its leaves are opposite, pinnate and dark
green, the leaflets are in three pairs, with an odd one, and are
pointed, the terminal one larger and with a tapering point. The
fragrant white flowers bloom from June to October; and, as they
are found chiefly on the young shoots, the plant should only be
pruned in the autumn. Varieties with golden and silver-edged
leaves and one with double flowers are known.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The zambak or Arabian jasmine, <i>J. Sambac</i>, is an evergreen white-flowered
climber, 6 or 8 ft. high, introduced into Britain in the latter
part of the 17th century. Two varieties introduced somewhat later
are respectively 3-leaved and double-flowered, and these, as well as
that with normal flowers, bloom throughout the greater part of the
year. On account of their exquisite fragrance the flowers are
highly esteemed in the East, and are frequently referred to by the
Persian and Arabian poets. An oil obtained by boiling the leaves is
used to anoint the head for complaints of the eye, and an oil obtained
from the roots is used medicinally to arrest the secretion of milk.
The flowers of one of the double varieties are held sacred to Vishnu,
and used as votive offerings in Hindu religious ceremonies. The
Spanish, or Catalonian jasmine, <i>J. grandiflorum</i>, a native of the
north-west Himalaya, and cultivated both in the old and new
world, is very like <i>J. officinale</i>, but differs in the size of the leaflets;
the branches are shorter and stouter, and the flowers very much
larger, and reddish underneath. By grafting it on two-year-old
plants of <i>J. officinale</i>, an erect bush about 3 ft. high is obtained,
requiring no supports. In this way it is very extensively cultivated
at Cannes and Grasse, in the south of France; the plants are set in
rows, fully exposed to the sun; they come into full bearing the second
year after grafting; the blossoms, which are very large and intensely
fragrant, are produced from July till the end of October, but those
of August and September are the most odoriferous.</p>

<p>The aroma is extracted by the process known as <i>enfleurage</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> absorption by a fatty body, such as purified lard or olive oil.
Square glass trays framed with wood about 3 in. deep are spread
over with grease about half an inch thick, in which ridges are made
to facilitate absorption, and sprinkled with freshly gathered flowers,
which are renewed every morning during the whole time the plant
remains in blossom; the trays are piled up in stacks to prevent the
evaporation of the aroma; and finally the pomade is scraped off the
glass, melted at as low a temperature as possible, and strained.
When oil is employed as the absorbent, coarse cotton cloths previously
saturated with the finest olive oil are laid on wire-gauze
frames, and repeatedly covered in the same manner with fresh
flowers; they are then squeezed under a press, yielding what is termed
<i>huile antique au jasmin</i>. Three pounds of flowers will perfume 1 &#8468;
of grease&mdash;this is exhausted by maceration in 1 pt. of rectified spirit
to form the &ldquo;extract.&rdquo; An essential oil is distilled from jasmine in
Tunis and Algeria, but its high price prevents its being used to any
extent. The East Indian oil of jasmine is a compound largely
contaminated with sandalwood-oil.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characters of <i>J. odoratissimum</i>, a native of the
Canary Islands and Madeira, consist principally in the alternate,
obtuse, ternate and pinnate leaves, the 3-flowered terminal peduncles
and the 5-cleft yellow corolla with obtuse segments. The flowers
have the advantage of retaining when dry their natural perfume,
which is suggestive of a mixture of jasmine, jonquil and orange-blossom.
In China <i>J. paniculatum</i> is cultivated as an erect shrub,
known as <i>sieu-hing-hwa</i>; it is valued for its flowers, which are used
with those of <i>J. Sambac</i>, in the proportion of 10 &#8468; of the former to
30 &#8468; of the latter, for scenting tea&mdash;40 &#8468; of the mixture being required
for 100 &#8468; of tea. <i>J. angustifolium</i> is a beautiful evergreen
climber 10 to 12 ft. high, found in the Coromandel forests, and introduced
into Britain during the present century. Its leaves are of a
bright shining green; its large terminal flowers are white with a
faint tinge of red, fragrant and blooming throughout the year.</p>

<p>In Cochin China a decoction of the leaves and branches of
<i>J. nervosum</i> is taken as a blood-purifier; and the bitter leaves of
<i>J. floribundum</i> (called in Abyssinia <i>habbez-zelim</i>) mixed with kousso
is considered a powerful anthelmintic, especially for tapeworm; the
leaves and branches are added to some fermented liquors to increase
their intoxicating quality. In Catalonia and in Turkey the wood of
the jasmine is made into long, slender pipe-stems, highly prized by
the Moors and Turks. Syrup of jasmine is made by placing in a jar
alternate layers of the flowers and sugar, covering the whole with
wet cloths and standing it in a cool place; the perfume is absorbed
by the sugar, which is converted into a very palatable syrup.
The important medicinal plant known in America as the &ldquo;Carolina
jasmine&rdquo; is not a true jasmine (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gelsemium</a></span>).</p>

<p>Other hardy species commonly cultivated in gardens are the low
or Italian yellow-flowered jasmine, <i>J. humile</i>, an East Indian species
introduced and now found wild in the south of Europe, an erect
shrub 3 or 4 ft. high, with angular branches, alternate and mostly
ternate leaves, blossoming from June to September; the common
yellow jasmine, <i>J. fruticans</i>, a native of southern Europe and the
Mediterranean region, a hardy evergreen shrub, 10 to 12 ft. high,
with weak, slender stems requiring support, and bearing yellow,
odourless flowers from spring to autumn; and <i>J. nudiflorum</i> (China),
which bears its bright yellow flowers in winter before the leaves
appear. It thrives in almost any situation and grows rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JASON<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (<span class="grk" title="Iasôn">&#7992;&#940;&#963;&#969;&#957;</span>), in Greek legend, son of Aeson, king of Iolcus
in Thessaly. He was the leader of the Argonautic expedition
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Argonauts</a></span>). After he returned from it he lived at Corinth
with his wife Medea (<i>q.v.</i>) for many years. At last he put away
Medea, in order to marry Glauce (or Creusa), daughter of the
Corinthian king Creon. To avenge herself, Medea presented
the new bride with a robe and head-dress, by whose magic properties
the wearer was burnt to death, and slew her children by
Jason with her own hand. A later story represents Jason as
reconciled to Medea (Justin, xlii. 2). His death was said to have
been due to suicide through grief, caused by Medea&rsquo;s vengeance
(Diod. Sic. iv. 55); or he was crushed by the fall of the poop of
the ship &ldquo;Argo,&rdquo; under which, on the advice of Medea, he had
laid himself down to sleep (argument of Euripides&rsquo; <i>Medea</i>).
The name (more correctly Iason) means &ldquo;healer,&rdquo; and Jason is
possibly a local hero of Iolcus to whom healing powers were
attributed. The ancients regarded him as the oldest navigator,
and the patron of navigation. By the moderns he has been
variously explained as a solar deity; a god of summer; a god of
storm; a god of rain, who carries off the rain-giving cloud (the
golden fleece) to refresh the earth after a long period of drought.
Some regard the legend as a chthonian myth, Aea (Colchis)
being the under-world in the Aeolic religious system from which
Jason liberates himself and his betrothed; others, in view of
certain resemblances between the story of Jason and that of
Cadmus (the ploughing of the field, the sowing of the dragon&rsquo;s
teeth, the fight with the Sparti, who are finally set fighting with
one another by a stone hurled into their midst), associate both
with Demeter the corn-goddess, and refer certain episodes to
practices in use at country festivals, <i>e.g.</i> the stone throwing,
which, like the <span class="grk" title="ballêtys">&#946;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#973;&#962;</span> at the Eleusinia and the <span class="grk" title="lithobolia">&#955;&#953;&#952;&#959;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span> at

<p><i>Later Versions of the Legend.</i>&mdash;<i>Les fais et prouesses du noble et

century by Raoul Lefèvre on the basis of Benoît&rsquo;s <i>Roman de
Troie</i>, and presented to Philip of Burgundy, founder of the order
of the Golden Fleece. The manners and sentiments of the 15th
century are made to harmonize with the classical legends after
the fashion of the Italian pre-Raphaelite painters, who equipped
Jewish warriors with knightly lance and armour. The story is
well told; the digressions are few; and there are many touches of
domestic life and natural sympathy. The first edition is believed
to have been printed at Bruges in 1474.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JASPER,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> an opaque compact variety of quartz, variously
coloured and often containing argillaceous matter. The
colours are usually red, brown, yellow or green, and are due to
admixture with compounds of iron, either oxides or silicates.
Although the term jasper is now restricted to opaque quartz it is
certain that the ancient <i>jaspis</i> or <span class="grk" title="iaspis">&#7984;&#940;&#963;&#960;&#953;&#962;</span> was a stone of considerable
translucency. The jasper of antiquity was in many
cases distinctly green, for it is often compared with the emerald
and other green objects. Jasper is referred to in the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>
as being clear and green. Probably the jasper of the
ancients included stones which would now be classed as chalcedony,
and the emerald-like jasper may have been akin to our
chrysoprase. The Hebrew word <i>yashefeh</i> may have designated a
green jasper (cf. Assyrian <i>yashpu</i>). Professor Flinders Petrie has
suggested that the <i>odem</i>, the first stone on the High Priest&rsquo;s
breastplate, translated &ldquo;sard,&rdquo; was a red jasper, whilst <i>tarshish</i>,
the tenth stone, may have been a yellow jasper (Hastings&rsquo;s <i>Dict.
Bible</i>, 1902).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Many varieties of jasper are recognized. Riband jasper is a form
in which the colours are disposed in bands, as in the well-known
ornamental stone from Siberia, which shows a regular alternation
of dark red and green stripes. Egyptian jasper is a brown jasper,
occurring as nodules in the Lybian desert and in the Nile valley, and
characterized by a zonal arrangement of light and dark shades of
colour. Agate-jasper is a variety intermediate between true jasper
and chalcedony. Basanite, lydite, or Lydian stone, is a velvet-black
flinty jasper, used as a touchstone for testing the purity of
precious metals by their streak. Porcelain jasper is a clay indurated
by natural calcination.</p>

of the department of Jassy, Rumania; situated on the left bank
of the river Bahlui, an affluent of the Jijia, about 10 m. W. of the
Pruth and the Russian frontier. Pop. (1900), 78,067. Jassy
communicates by rail with Galatz on the Danube, Kishinev in
Bessarabia, and Czernowitz in Bukowina. The surrounding
country is one of uplands and woods, among which rise the
monasteries of Ceta&#7789;uia, Frumoasa, and Galata with its mineral
springs, the water-cure establishment of Rapide and the great
seminary of Socola. Jassy itself stands pleasantly amid vineyards
and gardens, partly on two hills, partly in the hollow
between. Its primitive houses of timber and plaster were mostly
swept away after 1860, when brick or stone came into general use,
and good streets were cut among the network of narrow, insanitary
lanes. Jassy is the seat of the metropolitan of Moldavia,
and of a Roman Catholic archbishop. Synagogues and churches
abound. The two oldest churches date from the reign of Stephen
the Great (1458-1504); perhaps the finest, however, are the 17th-century
metropolitan, St Spiridion and Trei Erarchi, the last a
curious example of Byzantine art, erected in 1639 or 1640 by
Basil the Wolf, and adorned with countless gilded carvings on
its outer walls and twin towers. The St Spiridion Foundation
(due to the liberality of Prince Gregory Ghika in 1727, and available
for the sick of all countries and creeds) has an annual income
of over £80,000, and maintains hospitals and churches in several
towns of Moldavia, besides the baths at Slanic in Walachia. The
main hospital in Jassy is a large building, and possesses a maternity
institution, a midwifery school, a chemical institute, an
inoculating establishment, &amp;c. A society of physicians and
naturalists has existed in Jassy since the early part of the 19th
century, and a number of periodicals are published. Besides the
university, founded by Prince Cuza in 1864, with faculties of
literature, philosophy, law, science and medicine, there are
a military academy and schools of art, music and commerce;
a museum, a fine hall and a theatre; the state library, where
the chief records of Rumanian history are preserved; an appeal
court, a chamber of commerce and several banks. The city is
the headquarters of the 4th army corps. It has an active trade

<p>The inscription by which the existence of a <i>Jassiorum municipium</i>
in the time of the Roman Empire is sought to be proved,
lies open to grave suspicion; but the city is mentioned as early
as the 14th century, and probably does derive its name from
the Jassians, or Jazygians, who accompanied the Cumanian
invaders. It was often visited by the Moldavian court. About
1564, Prince Alexander Lapusneanu, after whom one of the chief
streets is named, chose Jassy for the Moldavian capital, instead
of Suceava (now Suczawa, in Bukowina). It was already
famous as a centre of culture. Between 1561 and 1563 an excellent
school and a Lutheran church were founded by the Greek
adventurer, Jacob Basilicus (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rumania</a></span>: <i>History</i>). In 1643
the first printed book published in Moldavia was issued from a
press established by Basil the Wolf. He also founded a school, the
first in which the mother-tongue took the place of Greek. Jassy
was burned by the Tatars in 1513, by the Turks in 1538, and by
the Russians in 1686. By the Peace of Jassy the second Russo-Turkish
War was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek insurrection
under Ypsilanti in 1821 led to the storming of the city by the
Turks in 1822. In 1844 there was a severe conflagration. For
the loss caused to the city in 1861 by the removal of the seat
of government to Bucharest the constituent assembly voted
£148,150, to be paid in ten annual instalments, but no payment
was ever made.</p>

<p><span class="bold">J&#256;TAKA,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> the technical name, in Buddhist literature, for a
story of one or other of the previous births of the Buddha. The
word is also used for the name of a collection of 547 of such
stories included, by a most fortunate conjuncture of circumstances,
in the Buddhist canon. This is the most ancient and the
most complete collection of folk-lore now extant in any literature
in the world. As it was made at latest in the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
it can be trusted not to give any of that modern or European
colouring which renders suspect much of the folk-lore collected
by modern travellers.</p>

<p>Already in the oldest documents, drawn up by the disciples
soon after the Buddha&rsquo;s death, he is identified with certain
ancient sages of renown. That a religious teacher should claim
to be successor of the prophets of old is not uncommon in the
history of religions. But the current belief in metempsychosis
led, or enabled, the early Buddhists to make a much wider claim.
It was not very long before they gradually identified their master
with the hero of each of the popular fables and stories of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
they were so fond. The process must have been complete by the
middle of the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; for we find at that date illustrations
of the J&#257;takas in the bas-reliefs on the railing round the
Bharahat tope with the titles of the J&#257;taka stories inscribed
above them in the characters of that period.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The hero of each
story is made into a Bodhisatta; that is, a being who is destined,
after a number of subsequent births, to become a Buddha. This
rapid development of the Bodhisatta theory is the distinguishing
feature in the early history of Buddhism, and was both cause and
effect of the simultaneous growth of the J&#257;taka book. In
adopting the folk-lore and fables already current in India, the
Buddhists did not change them very much. The stories as
preserved to us, are for the most part Indian rather than Buddhist.
The ethics they inculcate or suggest are milk for babes;
very simple in character and referring almost exclusively to
matters common to all schools of thought in India, and indeed
elsewhere. Kindness, purity, honesty, generosity, worldly
wisdom, perseverance, are the usual virtues praised; the higher
ethics of the Path are scarcely mentioned. These stories, popular
with all, were especially appreciated by that school of Buddhists
that laid stress on the Bodhisatta theory&mdash;a school that obtained
its chief support, and probably had its origin, in the extreme
north-west of India and in the highlands of Asia. That school
adopted, from the early centuries of our era, the use of Sanskrit,
instead of Pali, as the means of literary expression. It is almost
impossible, therefore, that they would have carried the canonical
Pali book, voluminous as it is, into Central Asia. Shorter collections
of the original stories, written in Sanskrit, were in vogue
among them. One such collection, the J&#257;taka-m&#257;l&#257;, by &#256;rya
S&#363;ra (6th century), is still extant. Of the existence of another
collection, though the Sanskrit original has not yet been found,
we have curious evidence. In the 6th century a book of Sanskrit
fables was translated into Pahlavi, that is, old Persian (see
Bidpai). In succeeding centuries this work was retranslated into
Arabic and Hebrew, thence into Latin and Greek and all the
modern languages of Europe. The book bears a close resemblance
to the earlier chapters of a late Sanskrit fable book
called, from its having five chapters, the <i>Pancha tantra</i>, or
Pentateuch.</p>

<p>The introduction to the old J&#257;taka book gives the life of the
historical Buddha. That introduction must also have reached
Persia by the same route. For in the 8th century St John of
Damascus put the story into Greek under the title of <i>Barlaam
and Josaphat</i>. This story became very popular in the West. It
was translated into Latin, into seven European languages, and
even into Icelandic and the dialect of the Philippine Islands.
Its hero, that is the Buddha, was canonized as a Christian saint;
and the 27th of November was officially fixed as the date for
his adoration as such.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The book popularly known in Europe as <i>Aesop&rsquo;s Fables</i> was not
written by Aesop. It was put together in the 14th century at
Constantinople by a monk named Planudes, and he drew largely for
his stories upon those in the J&#257;taka book that had reached Europe
along various channels. The fables of Babrius and Phaedrus,
written respectively in the 1st century before, and in the 1st century
after, the Christian era, also contain J&#257;taka stories known in India
in the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> A great deal has been written on this
curious question of the migration of fables. But we are still very
far from being able to trace the complete history of each story in
the J&#257;taka book, or in any one of the later collections. For India
itself the record is most incomplete. We have the original J&#257;taka
book in text and translation. The history of the text of the Pancha
tantra, about a thousand years later, has been fairly well traced out.
But for the intervening centuries scarcely anything has been done.
There are illustrations, in the bas-reliefs of the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, of
J&#257;takas not contained in the J&#257;taka book. Another collection,
the <i>Cariyâ pi&#7789;aka</i>, of about the same date, has been edited, but not
translated. Other collections both in Pali and Sanskrit are known
to be extant in MS; and a large number of J&#257;taka stories, not
included in any formal collection, are mentioned, or told in full, in
other works.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JÁTIVA<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (formerly written <span class="sc">Xativa</span>), or <span class="sc">San Felipe de Játiva</span>,
a town of eastern Spain, in the province of Valencia, on the right
bank of the river Albaida, a tributary of the Júcar, and at the
junction of the Valencia-Murcia and Valencia-Albacete railways.
Pop. (1900), 12,600. Játiva is built on the margin of a fertile
and beautiful plain, and on the southern slopes of the Monte
Bernisa, a hill with two peaks, each surmounted by a castle.
With its numerous fountains, and spacious avenues shaded
with elms or cypresses, the town has a clean and attractive
appearance. Its collegiate church, dating from 1414, but rebuilt
about a century later in the Renaissance style, was formerly a
cathedral, and is the chief among many churches and convents.
The town-hall and a church on the castle hill are partly constructed
of inscribed Roman masonry, and several houses date
from the Moorish occupation. There is a brisk local trade in
grain, fruit, wine, oil and rice.</p>

<p>Játiva was the Roman Saetabis, afterwards Valeria Augusta,
of Carthaginian or Iberian origin. Pliny (23-79) and Martial
(<i>c.</i> 40-102) mention the excellence of its linen cloth. Under the
Visigoths (<i>c.</i> 483-711) it became an episcopal see; but early in
the 8th century it was captured by the Moors, under whom it
attained great prosperity, and received its present name. It was
reconquered by James I. of Aragon (1213-1276). During the 15th
and 16th centuries, Játiva was the home of many members of
the princely house of Borgia or Borja, who migrated hither from
the town of Borja in the province of Saragossa. Alphonso
Borgia, afterwards Pope Calixtus III., and Rodrigo Borgia,
afterwards Pope Alexander VI., were natives of Játiva, born
respectively in 1378 and 1431. The painter Jusepe Ribera was
also born here in 1588. Owing to its gallant defence against the
troops of the Archduke Charles in the war of the Spanish succession,
Játiva received the additional name of San Felipe from
Philip V. (1700-1746).</p>

<p><span class="bold">J&#256;TS,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Juts</span>, a people of north-western India, who numbered
altogether more than 7 millions in 1901. They form a considerable
proportion of the population in the Punjab, R&#257;jputana and the
adjoining districts of the United Provinces, and are also widely
scattered through Sind and Baluchistan. Some writers have identified
the Juts with the ancient Getae, and there is strong reason
to believe them a degraded tribe of R&#257;jputs, whose Scythic origin
has also been maintained. Hindu legends point to a prehistoric
occupation of the Indus valley by this people, and at the time
of the Mahommedan conquest of Sind (712) they, with a cognate
tribe called Meds, constituted the bulk of the population. They
enlisted under the banner of Mahommed bin K&#257;sim, but at a
later date offered a vigorous resistance to the Arab invaders.
In 836 they were overthrown by Amran, who imposed on them
a tribute of dogs, and used their arms to vanquish the Meds. In
1025, however, they had gathered audacity, not only to invade
Mansura, and compel the abjuration of the Mussulman amir, but
to attack the victorious army of Mahm&#363;d, laden with the spoil of
Somn&#257;th. Chastisement duly ensued: a formidable flotilla,
collected at M&#363;lt&#257;n, shattered in thousands the comparatively
defenceless J&#257;t boats on the Indus, and annihilated their national
pretensions. It is not until the decay of the Mogul Empire that
the J&#257;ts again appear in history. One branch of them, settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
south of Agra, mainly by bold plundering raids founded two
dynasties which still exist at Bharatpur (<i>q.v.</i>) and Dholpur (<i>q.v.</i>).
Another branch, settled north-west of Delhi, who adopted the Sikh
religion, ultimately made themselves dominant throughout the
Punjab (<i>q.v.</i>) under Ranjit Singh, and are now represented in their
original home by the Phulkian houses of Patiala (<i>q.v.</i>), Jind (<i>q.v.</i>)
and Nabha (<i>q.v.</i>). It is from this latter branch that the Sikh
regiments of the Indian army are recruited. The J&#257;ts are mainly
agriculturists and cattle breeders. In their settlements on the
Ganges and Jumna, extending as far east as Bareilly, they are
divided into two great clans, the Dhe and the Hele; while in the
Punjab there are said to be one hundred different sections.
Their religion varies with locality. In the Punjab they have
largely embraced Sikh tenets, while in Sind and Baluchistan
they are Mahommedans. In appearance they are not ill-favoured
though extremely dark; they have good teeth, and large beards,
sometimes stained with indigo. Their inferiority of social position,
however, to some extent betrays itself in their aspect, and
tends to be perpetuated by their intellectual apathy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAUBERT, PIERRE AMÉDÉE ÉMILIEN PROBE<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1779-1847),
French Orientalist, was born at Aix in Provence on the
3rd of June 1779. He was one of the most distinguished
pupils of Silvestre de Sacy, whose funeral <i>Discours</i> he pronounced
in 1838. Jaubert acted as interpreter to Napoleon in
Egypt in 1798-1799, and on his return to Paris held various posts
under government. In 1802 he accompanied Sebastiani on his
Eastern mission; and in 1804 he was at Constantinople. Next
year he was despatched to Persia to arrange an alliance with
the shah; but on the way he was seized and imprisoned in a dry
cistern for four months by the pasha of Bayazid. The pasha&rsquo;s
death freed Jaubert, who successfully accomplished his mission,
and rejoined Napoleon at Warsaw in 1807. On the eve of
Napoleon&rsquo;s downfall he was appointed chargé d&rsquo;affaires at
Constantinople. The restoration ended his diplomatic career,
but in 1818 he undertook a journey with government aid to
Tibet, whence he succeeded in introducing into France 400
Kashmir goats. The rest of his life Jaubert spent in study, in
writing and in teaching. He became professor of Persian in
the collège de France, and director of the école des langues
orientales, and in 1830 was elected member of the Académie
des Inscriptions. In 1841 he was made a peer of France and
councillor of state. He died in Paris on the 28th of January,
1847.</p>

French politician, was born on the 14th of November 1757 at
Tournon (Seine-et-Marne) of a Protestant family, protected by
the prince de Condé, whose regiment he entered. He adopted
revolutionary ideas and became colonel of his regiment. In
the Assembly, to which he was returned in 1791 by the department
of Seine-et-Marne, he voted generally with the minority,
and his views being obviously too moderate for his colleagues
he resigned in 1792 and was soon after arrested on suspicion of
being a reactionary. Mme de Staël procured his release from
P. L. Manuel just before the September massacres. He accompanied
Talleyrand on his mission to England, returning to
France after the execution of Louis XVI. He lived in retirement
until the establishment of the Consulate, when he entered the
tribunate, of which he was for some time president. In 1803 he
entered the senate, and next year became attached to the household
of Joseph Bonaparte. Presently his imperialist views
cooled, and at the Restoration he became minister of state and a
peer of France. At the second Restoration he was for a brief
period minister of marine, but held no further office. He
devoted himself to the support of the Protestant interest in
France. A member of the upper house throughout the reign of
Louis Philippe, he was driven into private life by the establishment
of the Second Republic, but lived to see the <i>Coup d&rsquo;état</i> and
to rally to the government of Louis Napoleon, dying in Paris

which it was burned down three times, permanently injured

<p><span class="bold">JAUNDICE<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (Fr. <i>jaunisse</i>, from <i>jaune</i>, yellow), or <span class="sc">Icterus</span>
(from its resemblance to the colour of the golden oriole, of which
Pliny relates that if a jaundiced person looks upon it he recovers
but the bird dies), a term in medicine applied to a yellow coloration
of the skin and other parts of the body, depending in most
instances on some derangement affecting the liver. This yellow
colour is due to the presence in the blood of bile or of some of the
elements of that secretion. Jaundice, however, must be regarded
more as a symptom of some morbid condition previously
existing than as a disease <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>Cases with jaundice may be divided into three groups.</p>

<p>1. <i>Obstructive Jaundice.</i>&mdash;Any obstruction of the passage
of bile from the liver into the intestinal canal is sooner or later
followed by the appearance of jaundice, which in such circumstances
is due to the absorption of bile into the blood.
The obstruction is due to one of the following causes: (1)
Obstruction by foreign bodies within the bile duct, <i>e.g.</i> gallstones
or parasites; (2) inflammation of the duodenum or the lining
membrane of the duct; (3) stricture or obliteration of the duct;
(4) a tumour growing from the duct; (5) pressure on the duct
from without, from the liver or other organ, or tumours arising
from them. Obstructions from these causes may be partial or
complete, and the degree of jaundice will vary accordingly, but
it is to be noted that extensive organic disease of the liver
may exist without the evidence of obstructive jaundice.</p>

<p>The effect upon the liver of impediments to the outflow of
bile such as those above indicated is in the first place an increase
in its size, the whole biliary passages and the liver cells being
distended with retained bile. This enlargement, however,
speedily subsides when the obstruction is removed, but should it
persist the liver ultimately shrinks and undergoes atrophy in its
whole texture. The bile thus retained is absorbed into the
system, and shows itself by the yellow staining seen to a greater
or less extent in all the tissues and many of the fluids of the
body. The kidneys, which in such circumstances act in some
measure vicariously to the liver and excrete a portion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
retained bile, are apt to become affected in their structure
by the long continuance of jaundice.</p>

<p>The symptoms of obstructive jaundice necessarily vary
according to the nature of the exciting cause, but there generally
exists evidence of some morbid condition before the yellow
coloration appears. Thus, if the obstruction be due to an
impacted gallstone in the common or hepatic duct, there will
probably be the symptoms of intense suffering characterizing
hepatic colic (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Colic</a></span>). In the cases most frequently seen&mdash;those,
namely, arising from simple catarrh of the bile ducts due to
gastro-duodenal irritation spreading through the common duct&mdash;the
first sign to attract attention is the yellow appearance of
the white of the eye, which is speedily followed by a similar
colour on the skin over the body generally. The yellow tinge
is most distinct where the skin is thin, as on the forehead,
breast, elbows, &amp;c. It may be also well seen in the roof of the
mouth, but in the lips and gums the colour is not observed till
the blood is first pressed from them. The tint varies, being in
the milder cases faint, in the more severe a deep saffron yellow,
while in extreme degrees of obstruction it may be of dark brown
or greenish hue. The colour can scarcely, if at all, be observed
in artificial light.</p>

<p>The urine exhibits well marked and characteristic changes in
jaundice which exist even before any evidence can be detected
on the skin or elsewhere. It is always of dark brown colour
resembling porter, but after standing in the air it acquires a
greenish tint. Its froth is greenish-yellow, and it stains with
this colour any white substance. It contains not only the bile
colouring matter but also the bile acids. The former is detected
by the play of colours yielded on the addition of nitric acid, the
latter by the purple colour, produced by placing a piece of lump
sugar in the urine tested, and adding thereto a few drops of
strong sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The contents of the bowels also undergo changes, being
characterized chiefly by their pale clay colour, which is in proportion
to the amount of hepatic obstruction, and to their consequent
want of admixture with bile. For the same reason they contain
a large amount of unabsorbed fatty matter, and have an
extremely offensive odour.</p>

<p>Constitutional symptoms always attend jaundice with obstruction.
The patient becomes languid, drowsy and irritable, and
has generally a slow pulse. The appetite is usually but not
always diminished, a bitter taste in the mouth is complained of,
while flatulent eructations arise from the stomach. Intolerable
itching of the skin is a common accompaniment of jaundice, and
cutaneous eruptions or boils are occasionally seen. Yellow
vision appears to be present in some very rare cases. Should
the jaundice depend on advancing organic disease of the liver,
such as cancer, the tinge becomes gradually deeper, and the
emaciation and debility more marked towards the fatal termination,
which in such cases is seldom long postponed. Apart from
this, however, jaundice from obstruction may exist for many
years, as in those instances where the walls of the bile ducts are
thickened from chronic catarrh, but where they are only partially
occluded. In the common cases of acute catarrhal jaundice
recovery usually takes place in two or three weeks.</p>

<p>The treatment of this form of jaundice bears reference to the
cause giving rise to the obstruction. In the ordinary cases of
simple catarrhal jaundice, or that following the passing of gallstones,
a light nutritious diet (milk, soups, &amp;c., avoiding saccharine
and farinaceous substances and alcoholic stimulants),
along with counter-irritation applied over the right side and the
use of laxatives and cholagogues, will be found to be advantageous.
Diaphoretics and diuretics to promote the action of the
skin and kidneys are useful in jaundice. In the more chronic
forms, besides the remedies above named, the waters of Carlsbad
are of special efficacy. In cases other than acute catarrhal,
operative interference is often called for, to remove the gallstones,
tumour, &amp;c., causing the obstruction.</p>

<p>2. <i>Toxaemic Jaundice</i> is observed to occur as a symptom in
certain fevers, <i>e.g.</i> yellow fever, ague, and in pyaemia also as
the effect of certain poisons, such as phosphorus, and the venom
of snake-bites. Jaundice of this kind is almost always slight,
and neither the urine nor the discharges from the bowels exhibit
changes in appearance to such a degree as in the obstructive
variety. Grave constitutional symptoms are often present, but
they are less to be ascribed to the jaundice than to the disease
with which it is associated.</p>

<p>3. <i>Hereditary Jaundice.</i>&mdash;Under this group there are the
jaundice of new-born infants, which varies enormously in
severity; the cases in which a slight form of jaundice obtains in
several members of the same family, without other symptoms,
and which may persist for years; and lastly the group of cases
with hypertrophic cirrhosis.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The name <i>malignant jaundice</i> is sometimes applied to that very
fatal form of disease otherwise termed acute yellow atrophy of the
liver (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Atrophy</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAUNPUR,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> a city and district of British India, in the Benares
division of the United Provinces. The city is on the left bank of
the river Gumti, 34 m. N.W. from Benares by rail. Pop. (1901),
42,771. Jaunpur is a very ancient city, the former capital of a
Mahommedan kingdom which once extended from Budaun and
Etawah to Behar. It abounds in splendid architectural monuments,
most of which belong to the period when the rulers of
Jaunpur were independent of Delhi. The fort of Feroz Shah
is in great part completely ruined, but there remain a fine gateway
of the 16th century, a mosque dating from 1376, and the <i>hammams</i>
or baths of Ibrahim Shah. Among other buildings may be
mentioned the Atala Masjid (1408) and the ruined Jinjiri Masjid,
mosques built by Ibrahim, the first of which has a great cloistered
court and a magnificent façade; the Dariba mosque constructed
by two of Ibrahim&rsquo;s governors; the Lal Darwaza erected
by the queen of Mahmud; the Jama Masjid (1438-1478) or great
mosque of Husain, with court and cloisters, standing on a raised
terrace, and in part restored in modern times; and finally the
splendid bridge over the Gumti, erected by Munim Khan, Mogul
governor in 1569-1573. During the Mutiny of 1857 Jaunpur
formed a centre of disaffection. The city has now lost its importance,
the only industries surviving being the manufacture
of perfumes and papier-mâché articles.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Jaunpur</span> has an area of 1551 sq. m. It forms
part of the wide Gangetic plain, and its surface is accordingly
composed of a thick alluvial deposit. The whole country is
closely tilled, and no waste lands break the continuous prospect
of cultivated fields. It is divided into two unequal parts by the
sinuous channel of the Gumti, a tributary of the Ganges, which
flows past the city of Jaunpur. Its total course within the
district is about 90 m., and it is nowhere fordable. It is crossed
by two bridges, one at Jaunpur and the other 2 m. lower down.
The Gumti is liable to sudden inundations during the rainy season,
owing to the high banks it has piled up at its entrance into the
Ganges, which act as dams to prevent the prompt outflow of its
flooded waters. These inundations extend to its tributary the
Sa&#299;. Much damage was thus effected in 1774; but the greatest
recorded flood took place in September 1871, when 4000 houses
in the city were swept away, besides 9000 more in villages
along its banks. The other rivers are the Sa&#299;, Barna, Pili
and Basohi. Lakes are numerous in the north and south; the
largest has a length of 8 m. Pop. (1901), 1,202,920, showing
a decrease of 5% in the decade. Sugar-refining is the principal
industry. The district is served by the line of the Oudh &amp;
Rohilkhand railway from Benares to Fyzabad, and by branches
of this and of the Bengal &amp; North-Western systems.</p>

<p>In prehistoric times Jaunpur seems to have formed a portion
of the Ajodhya principality, and when it first makes an appearance
in authentic history it was subject to the rulers of Benares.
With the rest of their dominions it fell under the yoke of the
Mussulman invaders in 1194. From that time the district
appears to have been ruled by a prince of the Kanauj dynasty,
as a tributary of the Mahommedan suzerain. In 1388 M&#257;lik
Sarwar Khw&#257;ja was sent by Mahommed Tughlak to govern the
eastern province. He fixed his residence at Jaunpur, made
himself independent of the Delhi court, and assumed the title of
Sultan-us-Shark, or &ldquo;eastern emperor.&rdquo; For nearly a century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
the Sharki dynasty ruled at Jaunpur, and proved formidable
rivals to the sovereigns of Delhi. The last of the dynasty was
Sultan Husain, who passed his life in a fierce and chequered
struggle for supremacy with Bahlol Lodi, then actual emperor
at Delhi. At length, in 1478, Bahlol succeeded in defeating his
rival in a series of decisive engagements. He took the city of
Jaunpur, but permitted the conquered Husain to reside there, and
to complete the building of his great mosque, the Jama Masjid,
which now forms the chief ornament of the town. Many other
architectural works in the district still bear witness to its greatness
under its independent Mussulman rulers. In 1775 the
district was made over to the British by the Treaty of Lucknow.
From that time nothing occurred which calls for notice till the
Mutiny. On the 5th of June 1857, when the news of the Benares
revolt reached Jaunpur, the sepoys mutinied. The district
continued in a state of complete anarchy till the arrival of the
Gurkha force from Azamgarh in September. In November the
surrounding country was lost again, and it was not till May 1858
that the last smouldering embers of disaffection were stifled by
the repulse of the insurgent leader at the hands of the people
themselves.</p>

It is the typical conveyance for persons in Ireland (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Car</a></span>).
The first part of the word is generally taken to be identical with
the verb &ldquo;to jaunt,&rdquo; now only used in the sense of to go on a

a horse caracole or prance, hence to jolt or bump up and down.
It would apparently be a variant of &ldquo;jaunce,&rdquo; of the same meaning,
which is supposed to be taken from O. Fr. <i>jancer</i>. Skeat
takes the origin of jaunt and jaunce to be Scandinavian, and
connects them with the Swedish dialect word <i>ganta</i>, to romp;
and he finds cognate bases in such words as &ldquo;jump,&rdquo; &ldquo;high
jinks.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;jaunty,&rdquo; sprightly, especially used of anything
done with an easy nonchalant air, is a corruption of
&ldquo;janty,&rdquo; due to confusion with &ldquo;jaunt.&rdquo; &ldquo;Janty,&rdquo; often spelt

<p><span class="bold">JAUREGUI, JUAN<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1562-1582), a Biscayan by birth, was in
1582 in the service of a Spanish merchant, Gaspar d&rsquo;Anastro,
who was resident at Antwerp. Tempted by the reward of
80,000 ducats offered by Philip II. of Spain for the assassination
of William the Silent, prince of Orange, but being himself without
courage to undertake the task, d&rsquo;Anastro, with the help of
his cashier Venero, persuaded Jauregui to attempt the murder
for the sum of 2877 crowns. On Sunday the 18th of March
1582, as the prince came out of his dining-room Jauregui offered
him a petition, and William had no sooner taken it into his hand
than Jauregui fired a pistol at his head. The ball pierced the
neck below the right ear and passed out at the left jaw-bone;
but William ultimately recovered. The assassin was killed on
the spot.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAURÉGUIBERRY, JEAN BERNARD<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (1815-1887), French
admiral, was born at Bayonne on the 26th of August 1815. He
entered the navy in 1831, was made a lieutenant in 1845, commander
in 1856, and captain in 1860. After serving in the
Crimea and in China, and being governor of Senegal, he was
promoted to rear-admiral in 1869. He served on land during
the second part of the Franco-German War of 1870-71, in the
rank of auxiliary general of division. He was present at Coulmiers,
Villépion and Loigny-Poupry, in command of a division,
and in Chanzy&rsquo;s retreat upon Le Mans and the battle at that
place in command of a corps. He was the most distinguished
of the many naval officers who did good service in the military
operations. On the 9th of December he had been made vice-admiral,
and in 1871 he commanded the fleet at Toulon; in 1875
he was a member of the council of admiralty; and in October
1876 he was appointed to command the evolutionary squadron
in the Mediterranean. In February 1879 he became minister of
the navy in the Waddington cabinet, and on the 27th of May
following was elected a senator for life. He was again minister
of the navy in the Freycinet cabinet in 1880. A fine example of
the fighting French seaman of his time, Jauréguiberry died at
Paris on the 21st of October 1887.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JÁUREGUI Y AGUILAR, JUAN MARTÍNEZ DE<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (1583-1641),
Spanish poet, was baptized at Seville on the 24th of November
1583. In due course he studied at Rome, returning to Spain
shortly before 1610 with a double reputation as a painter and a
poet. A reference in the preface to the <i>Novelas exemplares</i> has
been taken to mean that he painted the portrait of Cervantes,
who, in the second part of <i>Don Quixote</i>, praises the translation
of Tasso&rsquo;s <i>Aminta</i> published at Rome in 1607. Jáuregui&rsquo;s
<i>Rimas</i> (1618), a collection of graceful lyrics, is preceded by a
controversial preface which attracted much attention on account
of its outspoken declaration against <i>culteranismo</i>. Through the
influence of Olivares, he was appointed groom of the chamber
to Philip IV., and gave an elaborate exposition of his artistic
doctrines in the <i>Discurso poético contra el hablar culto y oscuro</i>
(1624), a skilful attack on the new theories, which procured for
its author the order of Calatrava. It is plain, however, that the
shock of controversy had shaken Jáuregui&rsquo;s convictions, and
his poem <i>Orfeo</i> (1624) is visibly influenced by Góngora. Jáuregui
died at Madrid on the 11th of January 1641, leaving behind him
a translation of the <i>Pharsalia</i> which was not published till 1684.
This rendering reveals Jáuregui as a complete convert to the
new school, and it has been argued that, exaggerating the
affinities between Lucan and Góngora&mdash;both of Cordovan
descent&mdash;he deliberately translated the thought of the earlier
poet into the vocabulary of the later master. This is possible;
but it is at least as likely that Jáuregui unconsciously yielded to
the current of popular taste, with no other intention than that
of conciliating the public of his own day.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAURÈS, JEAN LÉON<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (1859-&emsp;&emsp;), French Socialist leader,
was born at Castres (Tarn) on the 3rd of September 1859. He
was educated at the lycée Louis-le-Grand and the école normale
supérieure, and took his degree as associate in philosophy in
1881. After teaching philosophy for two years at the lycée of
Albi (Tarn), he lectured at the university of Toulouse. He was
elected republican deputy for the department of Tarn in 1885.
In 1889, after unsuccessfully contesting Castres, he returned to
his professional duties at Toulouse, where he took an active
interest in municipal affairs, and helped to found the medical
faculty of the university. He also prepared two theses for his
doctorate in philosophy, <i>De primis socialismi germanici lineamentis
apud Lutherum, Kant, Fichte et Hegel</i> (1891), and <i>De la
réalité du monde sensible</i>. In 1902 he gave energetic support to
the miners of Carmaux who went out on strike in consequence
of the dismissal of a socialist workman, Calvignac; and in the
next year he was re-elected to the chamber as deputy for Albi.
Although he was defeated at the elections of 1898 and was for
four years outside the chamber, his eloquent speeches made him
a force in politics as an intellectual champion of socialism. He
edited the <i>Petite République</i>, and was one of the most energetic
defenders of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. He approved of the
inclusion of M. Millerand, the socialist, in the Waldeck-Rousseau
ministry, though this led to a split with the more revolutionary
section led by M. Guesde. In 1902 he was again returned as
deputy for Albi, and during the Combes administration his influence
secured the coherence of the radical-socialist coalition
known as the <i>bloc</i>. In 1904 he founded the socialist paper,
<i>L&rsquo;Humanité</i>. The French socialist groups held a congress at
Rouen in March 1905, which resulted in a new consolidation;
the new party, headed by MM. Jaurès and Guesde, ceased to
co-operate with the radicals and radical-socialists, and became
known as the unified socialists, pledged to advance a collectivist
programme. At the general elections of 1906 M. Jaurès was
again elected for the Tarn. His ability and vigour were now
generally recognized; but the strength of the socialist party, and
the practical activity of its leader, still had to reckon with the
equally practical and vigorous liberalism of M. Clemenceau.
The latter was able to appeal to his countrymen (in a notable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
speech in the spring of 1906) to rally to a radical programme
which had no socialist Utopia in view; and the appearance in
him of a strong and practical radical leader had the result of
considerably diminishing the effect of the socialist propaganda.
M. Jaurès, in addition to his daily journalistic activity, published
<i>Les preuves; affaire Dreyfus</i> (1900); <i>Action socialiste</i> (1899);
<i>Études socialistes</i> (1902), and, with other collaborators, <i>Histoire
socialiste</i> (1901), &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAVA,<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> one of the larger islands of that portion of the Malay
Archipelago which is distinguished as the Sunda Islands. It
lies between 105° 12&prime; 40&Prime; (St Nicholas Point) and 114° 35&prime; 38&Prime; E.
(Cape Seloko) and between 5° 52&prime; 34&Prime; and 8° 46&prime; 46&Prime; S. It has
a total length of 622 m. from Pepper Bay in the west to Banyuwangi
in the east, and an extreme breadth of 121 m. from Cape
Bugel in Japara to the coast of Jokjakarta, narrowing towards
the middle to about 55 m. Politically and commercially it is
important as the seat of the colonial government of the Dutch
East Indies, all other parts of the Dutch territory being
distinguished as the Outer Possessions (<i>Buitenbezittungens</i>).
According to the triangulation survey (report published in 1901)
the area of Java proper is 48,504 sq. m.; of Madura, the large
adjacent and associated island, 1732; and of the smaller islands
administratively included with Java and Madura 1416, thus
making a total of 50,970 sq. m. The more important of these
islands are the following: Pulau Panaitan or Princes Island
(<i>Prinseneiland</i>), 47 sq. m., lies in the Sunda Strait, off the south-western
peninsula of the main island, from which it is separated
by the Behouden Passage. The Thousand Islands are situated
almost due N. of Batavia. Of these five were inhabited in 1906
by about 1280 seafarers from all parts and their descendants.
The Karimon Java archipelago, to the north of Semarang,
numbers twenty-seven islands with an area of 16 sq. m. and a
population of about 800 (having one considerable village on the
main island). Bavian<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (Bawian), 100 m. N. of Surabaya, is a
ruined volcano with an area of 73 sq. m. and a population of
about 44,000. About a third of the men are generally absent as
traders or coolies. In Singapore and Sumatra they are known as
Boyans. They are devout Mahommedans and many of them
make the pilgrimage to Mecca. The Sapudi and Kangean
archipelagoes are eastward continuations of Madura. The former,
thirteen in all, with an area of 58 sq. m. and 53,000 inhabitants,
export cattle, dried fish and trepang; and many of the male population
work as day labourers in Java or as lumbermen in Sumbawa,
Flores, &amp;c. The main island of the Kangians has an area
of 19 sq. m.; the whole group 23 sq. m. It is best known for
its limestone caves and its buffaloes. Along the south coast the
islands are few and small&mdash;Klapper or Deli, Trouwers or Tingal,
Nusa Kembangan, Sempu and Nusa Barung.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:1069px; height:425px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img284.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>From Sumatra on the W., Java is separated by the Sunda
Strait, which at the narrowest is only 14 m. broad, but widens
elsewhere to about 50 m. On the E. the strait of Bali, which
parts it from the island of that name, is at the northern end not
more than 1½ m. across. Through the former strong currents
run for the greater part of the day throughout the year, outwards
from the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean. In the strait of Bali
the currents are perhaps even stronger and are extremely
irregular. Pilots with local knowledge are absolutely necessary
for vessels attempting either passage. In spite of the strength
of the currents the Sunda Strait is steadily being diminished in
width, and the process if continued must result in a restoration
of that junction of Sumatra and Java which according to some
authorities formerly existed.<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>In general terms Java may be described as one of the breakwater
islands of the Indian Ocean&mdash;part of the mountainous
rim (continuous more or less completely with Sumatra) of the
partially submerged plateau which lies between the ocean on
the S. and the Chinese Sea on the N., and has the massive
island of Borneo as its chief subaerial portion. While the waves
and currents of the ocean sweep away most of the products of
denudation along the south coast or throw a small percentage
back in the shape of sandy downs, the Java Sea on the north&mdash;not
more than 50 fathoms deep&mdash;allows them to settle and to
form sometimes with extraordinary rapidity broad alluvial
tracts.<a name="fa3e" id="fa3e" href="#ft3e"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is customary and obvious to divide Java into three divisions,
the middle part of the island narrowing into a kind of isthmus,
and each of the divisions thus indicated having certain structural
characteristics of its own. West Java, which consists of Bantam,
Krawang and the Preanger Regencies, has an area of upwards of
18,000 sq. m. In this division the highlands lie for the most part
in a compact mass to the south and the lowlands form a continuous
tract to the north. The main portion of the uplands consists of the
Preanger Mountains, with the plateaus of Bandong, Pekalongan,
Tegal, Badung and Gurut, encircled with volcanic summits. On the
borders of the Preanger, Batavia and Bantam are the Halimon
Mountains (the Blue Mountains of the older travellers), reaching
their greatest altitudes in the volcanic summits of Gedeh and Salak.
To the west lie the highlands of Bantam, which extending northward
cut off the northern lowlands from the Sunda Strait. Middle Java
is the smallest of the three divisions, having an area of not much more
than 13,200 sq. m. It comprises Tegal, Pekalongan, Banyumas,
Bagelen, Kedu, Jokjakarta, Surakarta, and thus not only takes in
the whole of the isthmus but encroaches on the broad eastern portion
of the island. In the isthmus mountains are not so closely massed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
in the south nor the plains so continuous on the north. The watershed
culminating in Slamet lies almost midway between the ocean
and the Java Sea, and there are somewhat extensive lowlands in
the south. In that part of middle Java which physically belongs
to eastern Java there is a remarkable series of lowlands stretching
almost right across the island from Semarang in the north to Jokjakarta
in the south. Eastern Java comprises Rembang, Madiun, Kediri, Surabaya,
Pasuruan and Besuki, and has an area of about 17,500 sq. m.
In this division lowlands and highlands are intermingled in
endless variety except along the south coast, where the watershed-range
forms a continuous breakwater from Jokjakarta to Besuki.
The volcanic eminences, instead of rising in lines or groups, are
isolated.</p>

<p>For its area Java is one of the most distinctly volcanic regions of
the world. Volcanic forces made it, and volcanic forces have continued
to devastate and fertilize it. According to R. D. M. Verbeek
about 125 volcanic centres can be distinguished, a number which
may be increased or diminished by different methods of classification.
It is usual to arrange the volcanoes in the following
groups: westernmost Java 11 (all extinct); Preanger 50 (5 active);
Cheribon 2 (both extinct); Slamet 2 (1 active); middle Java 16
(2 active); Murio 2 (both extinct); Lavu 2 (extinct); Wilis 2 (extinct);
east Java 21 (5 active). The active volcanoes of the present time
are Gedeh, Tangkuban, Prahu, Gutar, Papandayan, Galung-gung,
Slamet, Sendor, Merapi,<a name="fa4e" id="fa4e" href="#ft4e"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Kalut (or Klut), Bromo, Semeru, Lamongan,
Raung, but the activity of many of these is trifling, consisting of
slight ejections of steam and scoriae.</p>

<p>The plains differ in surface and fertility, according to their geological
formation. Built up of alluvium and diluvium, the plains of the
north coast-lands in western and middle Java are at their lowest
levels, near the mouths of rivers and the sea, in many cases marshy
and abounding in lakes and coral remains, but for the rest they are
fertile and available for culture. The plains, too, along the south
coast of middle Java&mdash;of Banyumas and Bagelen&mdash;contain many
morasses as well as sandy stretches and dunes impeding the outlet
of the rivers. They are, nevertheless, available for the cultivation
more particularly of rice, and are thickly peopled. In eastern
Java, again, the narrow coast plains are to be distinguished from the
wider plains lying between the parallel chains of limestone and between
the volcanoes. The narrow plains of the north coast are
constituted of yellow clay and tuffs containing chalk, washed down
by the rivers from the mountain chains and volcanoes. Like the
western plains, they, too, are in many cases low and marshy, and
fringed with sand and dunes. The plains, on the other hand, at
some distance from the sea, or lying in the interior of eastern Java,
such as Surakarta, Madiun, Kediri, Pasuruan, Probolinggo and
Besuki, owe their formation to the volcanoes at whose bases they
lie, occupying levels as high as 1640 ft. down to 328 ft. above the
sea, whence they decline to the lower plains of the coast. Lastly,
the plains of Lusi, Solo and Brantas, lying between the parallel
chains in Japara, Rembang and Surabaya, are in part the product
of rivers formerly flowing at a higher level of 30 to 60 or 70 ft., in
part the product of the sea, dating from a time when the northern
part of the above-named residencies was an island, such as Madura,
the mountains of which are the continuation of the north parallel
chain, is still.</p>

<p>The considerable rivers of western Java all have their outlets on
the north coast, the chief among them being the Chi (Dutch Tji)
Tarum and the Chi Manuk. They are navigable for native boats and
rafts, and are used for the transport of coffee and salt. On the south
coast the Chi Tanduwi, on the east of the Preanger, is the only
stream available as a waterway, and this only for a few miles above its
mouth. In middle Java, also, the rivers discharging at the north
coast&mdash;the Pamali, Chomal, &amp;c.&mdash;are serviceable for the purposes
of irrigation and cultivation, but are navigable only near their
mouths. The rivers of the south coast&mdash;Progo, Serayu, Bogowonto,
and Upak, enriched by rills from the volcanoes&mdash;serve abundantly
to irrigate the plains of Bagelen, Banyumas, &amp;c. Their stony beds,
shallows and rapids, and the condition of their mouths lessen,
however, their value as waterways. More navigable are the larger
rivers of eastern Java. The Solo is navigable for large praus, or
native boats, as far up as Surakarta, and above that town for lighter
boats, as is also its affluent the Gentung. The canal constructed
in 1893 at the lower part of this river, and alterations effected at
its mouth, have proved of important service both in irrigating the
plain and facilitating the river&rsquo;s outlet into the sea. The Brantas
is also navigable in several parts. The smaller rivers of eastern
Java are, however, much in the condition of those of western Java.
They serve less as waterways than as reservoirs for the irrigation
of the fertile plains through which they flow.</p>

<p>The north coast of Java presents everywhere a low strand covered
with nipa or mangrove, morasses and fishponds, sandy stretches and
low dunes, shifting river-mouths and coast-lines, ports and roads,
demanding continual attention and regulation. The south coast
is of a different make. The dunes of Banyumas, Bagelen, and Jokjakarta,
ranged in three ridges, rising to 50 ft. high, and varying in
breadth from 300 to over 1600 ft., liable, moreover, to transformation
from tides and the east monsoon, oppose everywhere, also in
Preanger and Besuki, a barrier to the discharge of the rivers and the
drainage of the coast-lands. They assist the formation of lagoons
and morasses. At intervals in the dune coast, running in the
direction of the limestone mountains, there tower up steep inaccessible
masses of land, showing neither ports nor bays, hollowed out by
the sea, rising in perpendicular walls to a height of 160 ft. above
sea-level. Sometimes two branches project at right angles from
the chain on to the coast, forming a low bay between the capes
or ends of the projecting branches, from 1000 to 1600 ft. high.
Such a formation occurs frequently along the coast of Besuki,
presenting a very irregular coast-line. Of course the north coast is
of much greater commercial importance than the south coast.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;With the exception of a few small patches of schist,
supposed to be Cretaceous, the whole island, so far as is known, is
covered by deposits of Tertiary and Quaternary age. The ancient
&ldquo;schist formation,&rdquo; which occurs in Sumatra, Borneo, &amp;c., does not
rise to the surface anywhere in Java itself, but it is visible in the
island of Karimon Java off the north coast. The Cretaceous schists
have yielded fossils only at Banjarnegara, where a limestone with
Orbitolina is interstratified with them. They are succeeded unconformably
by Eocene deposits, consisting of sandstones with
coal-seams and limestones containing Nummulites, Alveolina and
Orthophragmina; and these beds are as limited in extent as the Cretaceous
schists themselves. Sedimentary deposits of Upper Tertiary
age are widely spread, covering about 38% of the surface. They
consist of breccias, marls and limestones containing numerous
fossils, and are for the most part Miocene but probably include a
part of the Pliocene also. They were laid down beneath the sea,
but have since been folded and elevated to considerable heights.
Fluviatile deposits of late Pliocene age have been found in the east
of Java, and it was in these that the remarkable anthropoid ape or
ape-like man, <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> of Dubois, was discovered.
The Quaternary deposits lie horizontally upon the upturned edges
of the Tertiary beds. They are partly marine and partly fluviatile,
the marine deposits reaching to a height of some 350 ft. above the
sea and thus indicating a considerable elevation of the island in
recent times.</p>

<p>The volcanic rocks of Java are of great importance and cover about
28% of the island. The eruptions began in the middle of the
Tertiary period, but did not attain their maximum until Quaternary
times, and many of the volcanoes are still active. Most of the
cones seem to lie along faults parallel to the axis of the island, or on
short cross fractures. The lavas and ashes are almost everywhere
andesites and basalts, with a little obsidian. Some of the volcanoes,
however, have erupted leucite rocks. Similar rocks, together with
phonolite, occur in the island of Bavian.<a name="fa5e" id="fa5e" href="#ft5e"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;Our knowledge of the climate of Batavia, and thus of
that of the lowlands of western Java, is almost perfect; but, rainfall
excepted, our information as to the climate of Java as a whole is
extremely defective. The dominant meteorological facts are simple
and obvious: Java lies in the tropics, under an almost vertical
sun, and thus has a day of almost uniform length throughout
the year.<a name="fa6e" id="fa6e" href="#ft6e"><span class="sp">6</span></a> It is also within the perpetual influence of the great
atmospheric movements passing between Asia and Australia; and
is affected by the neighbourhood of vast expanses of sea and land
(Borneo and Sumatra). There are no such maxima of temperature
as are recorded from the continents. The highest known at Batavia
was 96° F. in 1877 and the lowest 66° in the same year. The mean
annual temperature is 79°. The warmest months are May and
October, registering 79.5° and 79.46° respectively; the coldest
January and February with 77.63° and 77.7° respectively. The
daily range is much greater; at one o&rsquo;clock the thermometer has a
mean height of 84°; after two o&rsquo;clock it declines to about 73° at six
o&rsquo;clock; the greatest daily amplitude is in August and the least in
January and February. Eastern Java and the inland plains of
middle Java are said to be hotter, but scientific data are few. A
very slight degree of elevation above the seaboard plains produces
a remarkable difference in the climate, not so much in its mere
temperature as in its influence on health. The dwellers in the coast
towns are surprised at the invigorating effects of a change to health
resorts from 300 to 1200 ft. above sea-level; and at greater elevations
it may be uncomfortably cold at night, with chilly mists and
occasional frosts. The year is divided into two seasons by the prevailing
winds: the rainy season, that of the west monsoon, lasting
from November to March, and the dry season, that of the east monsoon,
during the rest of the year; the transition from one monsoon
to another&mdash;the &ldquo;canting&rdquo; of the monsoons&mdash;being marked by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
irregularities. On the whole, the east monsoon blows steadily for
a longer period than the west. The velocity of the wind is much less
than in Europe&mdash;not more in the annual mean at Batavia than 3 ft.
per second, against 12 to 18 ft. in Europe. The highest velocity
ever observed at Batavia was 25 ft. Wind-storms are rare and
hardly ever cyclonic. There are as a matter of course a large number
of purely local winds, some of them of a very peculiar kind, but few
of these have been scientifically dealt with. Thunder-storms are
extremely frequent; but the loss of life from lightning is probably
diminished by the fact that the palm-trees are excellent conductors.
At night the air is almost invariably still. The average rainfall at
Batavia is 72.28 in. per annum, of which 51.49 in. are contributed
by the west monsoon. The amount varies considerably from year
to year: in 1889, 1891 and 1897 there were about 47.24 in.; in 1868
and 1877 nearly 51.17, and in 1872 and 1882 no less than 94.8.
There are no long tracts of unbroken rainfall and no long periods of
continuous drought. The rainfall is heaviest in January, but it
rains only for about one-seventh of the time. Next in order come
February, March and December. August, the driest month, has
from three to five days of rain, though the amount is usually less
than an inch and not more than one and a half inches. The popular
description of the rain falling not in drops but streams was proved
erroneous by J. Wiesner&rsquo;s careful observations (see <i>Kais. Akad. d.
Wiss. Math. Naturw. Cl.</i> Bd. xiv., Vienna, 1895), which have been
confirmed by A. Woeikof (&ldquo;Regensintensität und Regendauer in
Batavia&rdquo; in <i>Z. für Met.</i>, 1907). The greatest rainfall recorded in
an hour (4.5 in.) is enormously exceeded by records even in Europe.
From observations taken for the meteorological authorities at a very
considerable number of stations, J. H. Boeseken constructed a map
in 1900 (<i>Tijdschr. v. h. Kon. Ned. Aardr. Gen.</i>, 1900; reproduced
in Veth, <i>Java</i>, iii. 1903). Among the outstanding facts are the
following. The south coasts of both eastern and middle Java have
a much heavier rainfall than the north. Majalenka has an annual
fall of 175 in. In western Java the maximal district consists of a
great ring of mountains from Salak and Gedeh in the west to Galung-gung
in the east, while the enclosed plateau-region of Chanjur Bandung
and Garut are not much different from the seaboard. The whole
of middle Java, with the exception of the north coast, has a heavy
rainfall. At Chilachap the annual rainfall is 151.43 in., 87.8 in. of
which is brought by the south-east monsoon. The great belt which includes
the Slamet and the Dieng, and the country on the south coast
between Chilachap and Parigi, are maximal. In comparison the
whole of eastern Java, with the exception of the mountains from
Wilis eastward to Ijen, has a low record which reaches its lowest
along the north coast.<a name="fa7e" id="fa7e" href="#ft7e"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;In respect of its fauna Java differs from Borneo, Sumatra
and the Malay Peninsula far more than these differ among themselves;
and, at the same time, it shows a close resemblance to the
Malay Peninsula, on the one hand, and to the Himalayas on the
other. Of the 176 mammals of the whole Indo-Malayan region
the greater number occur in Java. Of these 41 are found on
the continent of Asia, 8 are common to Java and Borneo, and 6 are
common to Java and Sumatra (see M. Weber, <i>Das Indo-Malay
Archipelago und die Geschichte seiner Thierwelt</i>, Jena, 1902). No
genus and only a few species are confined to the island. Of the land-birds
only a small proportion are peculiar. The elephant, the tapir,
the bear, and various other genera found in the rest of the region are
altogether absent. The Javanese rhinoceros (<i>Rhinoceros sundaicus</i>;
<i>sarak</i> in Javanese, <i>badak</i> in Sundanese), the largest of the mammals
on the island, differs from that of Sumatra in having one horn
instead of two. It ranges over the highest mountains, and its
regular paths, worn into deep channels, may be traced up the
steepest slopes and round the rims of even active volcanoes. Two
species of wild swine, <i>Sus vittatus</i> and <i>Sus verrucosus</i>, are exceedingly
abundant, the former in the hot, the latter in the temperate, region;
and their depredations are the cause of much loss to the natives,
who, however, being Mahommedans, to whom pork is abhorrent, do
not hunt them for the sake of their flesh. Not much less than the
rhinoceros is the banteng (<i>Bibos banteng</i> or <i>sundaicus</i>) found in all
the uninhabited districts between 2000 and 7000 ft. of elevation.
The kidang or muntjak (<i>Cervulus muntjac</i>) and the rusa or russa
(<i>Rusa hippelaphus</i> or <i>Russa russa</i>) are the representatives of the
deer kind. The former is a delicate little creature occurring singly
or in pairs both in the mountains and in the coast districts; the latter
lives in herds of fifty to a hundred in the grassy opens, giving
excellent sport to the native hunters. Another species (<i>Russa
kuhlii</i>) exists in Bavian. The kantjil (<i>Tragulus javanicus</i>) is a small
creature allied to the musk-deer but forming a genus by itself. It
lives in the high woods, for the most part singly, seldom in pairs.
It is one of the most peculiar of the Javanese mammals. The royal
tiger, the same species as that of India, is still common enough to
make a tiger-hunt a characteristic Javanese scene. The leopard
(<i>Felis pardus</i>) is frequent in the warm regions and often ascends to
considerable altitudes. Black specimens occasionally occur, but
the spots are visible on inspection; and the fact that in the Amsterdam
zoological gardens a black leopard had one of its cubs black and the
other normally spotted shows that this is only a case of melanism.
In the tree-tops the birds find a dangerous enemy in the matjan
rembak, or wild cat (<i>Felis minuta</i>), about the size of a common cat.
The dog tribe is represented by the fox-like adjag (<i>Cuon</i> or <i>Canis
sutilans</i>) which hunts in ferocious packs; and by a wild dog, <i>Canis
tenggeranus</i>, if this is not now exterminated. The Cheiroptera hold
a prominent place in the fauna, the principal genera being <i>Pteropus</i>,
<i>Cynonycteris</i>, <i>Cynopterus</i> and <i>Macroglossus</i>. Remarkable especially
for size is the kalong, or flying fox, <i>Pteropus edulis</i>, a fruit-eating
bat, which may be seen hanging during the day in black
clusters asleep on the trees, and in the evening hastening in long
lines to the favourite feeding grounds in the forest. The damage
these do to the young coco-nut trees, the maize and the sugar-palms
leads the natives to snare and shoot them; and their flesh is a
favourite food with Europeans, who prefer to shoot them by night
as, if shot by day, they often cling after death to the branches.
Smaller kinds of bats are most abundant, perhaps the commonest
being <i>Scotophilus Temminckii</i>. In certain places they congregate
in myriads, like sea-fowl on the cliffs, and their excrement produces
extensive guano deposits utilized by the people of Surakarta and
Madiun. The creature known to the Europeans as the flying-cat
and to the natives as the kubin is the <i>Galeopithecus volans</i> or <i>variagatus</i>&mdash;a
sort of transition from the bats to the lemuroids. Of these
last Java has several species held in awe by the natives for their
supposed power of fascination. The apes are represented by the
wou-wou (<i>Hylobates leuciscus</i>), the lutung, and kowi (<i>Semnopithecus
maurus</i> and <i>pyrrhus</i>), the surili (<i>Semnopithecus mitratus</i>), and the
munyuk (<i>Cercocebus</i>, or <i>Macacus, cynamolgos</i>), the most generally
distributed of all. From sunrise to sunset the wou-wou makes its
presence known, especially in the second zone where it congregates
in the trees, by its strange cry, at times harsh and cacophonous, at
times weird and pathetic. The lutung or black ape also prefers the
temperate region, though it is met with as high as 7000 ft. above
the sea and as low as 2000. The <i>Cercocebus</i> or grey ape keeps for
the most part to the warm coast lands. Rats (including the brown
Norway rat, often called <i>Mus javanicus</i>, as if it were a native; a
great plague); mice in great variety; porcupines (<i>Acanthion
javanicum</i>); squirrels (five species) and flying squirrels (four species)
represent the rodents. A hare, <i>Lepus nigricollis</i>, originally from
Ceylon, has a very limited habitat; the Insectivora comprise a
shrew-mouse (<i>Rachyura indica</i>), two species of tupaya and <i>Hylomys
suillus</i> peculiar to Java and Sumatra. The nearest relation to the
bears is <i>Arctictis binturong</i>. <i>Mydaus meliceps</i> and <i>Helictis orientalis</i>
represent the badgers. In the upper part of the mountains occurs
<i>Mustela Henrici</i>, and an otter (<i>Aonyx leptonyx</i>) in the streams of the
hot zone. The coffee rat (<i>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</i>), a civet cat
(<i>Viverricida indica</i>), the Javanese ichneumon (<i>Herpestes javanicus</i>),
and <i>Priodon gracilis</i> may also be mentioned.</p>

<p>In 1820, 176 species of birds were known in Java; by 1900 Vorderman
and O. Finsch knew 410. Many of these are, of course, rare
and occupy a limited habitat far from the haunts of man. Others
exist in myriads and are characteristic features in the landscape.
Water-fowl of many kinds, ducks, geese, storks, pelicans, &amp;c., give
life to sea-shore and lake, river and marsh. Snipe-shooting is a
<span class="correction" title="amended from favourtie">favourite</span> sport. Common night-birds are the owl (<i>Strix flammea</i>)
and the goat-sucker (<i>Caprimulgus affinis</i>). Three species of hornbill,
the year-bird of the older travellers (<i>Buceros plicatus</i>, <i>lunatus</i> and
<i>albirostris</i>) live in the tall trees of the forest zone. The Javanese
peacock is a distinct species (<i>Pavo muticus</i> or <i>spiciferus</i>), and even
exceeds the well-known Indian species in the splendour of its
plumage. <i>Gallus Bankiva</i> is famous as the reputed parent of all
barn-door fowls; <i>Gallus furcatus</i> is an exquisitely beautiful bird and
can be trained for cock-fighting. Of parrots two species only are
known: <i>Palaeornis Alexandri</i> or <i>javanicus</i> and the pretty little
grass-green <i>Curyllis pusilla</i>, peculiar to Java. As talkers and mimics
they are beaten by the <i>Gracula javanensis</i>, a favourite cage-bird
with the natives. A cuckoo, <i>Chrysococcyx basalis</i>, may be heard in
the second zone. The grass-fields are the foraging-grounds of
swarms of weaver-birds (<i>Plocula javanensis</i> and <i>Ploccus baya</i>). They
lay nearly as heavy a toll on the rice-fields as the gelatiks (<i>Munia
oryzivora</i>), which are everywhere the rice-growers&rsquo; principal foe.
Hawks and falcons make both an easy prey. The <i>Nictuarinas</i> or
honey-birds (eight species) take the place of the humming-bird,
which they rival in beauty and diminutiveness, ranging from the
lowlands to an altitude of 4000 ft. In the upper regions the birds,
like the plants, are more like those of Europe, and some of them&mdash;notably
the kanchilan (<i>Hyloterpe Philomela</i>)&mdash;are remarkable for
their song. The edible-nest swallow (<i>Collocalia fuciphaga</i>) builds
in caves in many parts of the island.<a name="fa8e" id="fa8e" href="#ft8e"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>As far back as 1859 P. Bleeker credited Java with eleven hundred
species of fish; and naturalists are perpetually adding to the number.<a name="fa9e" id="fa9e" href="#ft9e"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
In splendour and grotesqueness of colouring many kinds, as is well
known, look rather like birds than fish. In the neighbourhood of
Batavia about three hundred and eighty species are used as food by
the natives and the Chinese, who have added to the number by the
introduction of the goldfish, which reaches a great size. The sea
fish most prized by Europeans is <i>Lates calcarifer</i> (a perch). Of more
than one hundred species of snakes about twenty-four species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
(including the cobra di capella) are poisonous and these are responsible
for the deaths of between one hundred and two hundred persons
per annum. Adders and lizards are abundant. Geckos are familiar
visitants in the houses of the natives. There are two species of
crocodiles.</p>

<p>As in other tropical-rain forest lands the variety and abundance
of insects are amazing. At sundown the air becomes resonant for
hours with their myriad voices. The <i>Coleoptera</i> and the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
form the glory of all great collections for their size and magnificence.
Of butterflies proper five hundred species are known. Of the beetles
one of the largest and handsomest is <i>Chalcosoma atlas</i>. Among the
spiders (a numerously represented order) the most notable is a bird-killing
species, <i>Selene scomia javanensis</i>. In many parts the island
is plagued with ants, termites and mosquitoes. Crops of all kinds
are subject to disastrous attacks of creeping and winged foes&mdash;many
still unidentified (see especially Snellen van Hollenhoven,
<i>Essai d&rsquo;une faune entomologique de l&rsquo;Archipel Indo-néerlandais</i>).
Of still lower forms of life the profusion is no less perplexing. Among
the worms the <i>Perichaeta musica</i> reaches a length of about twenty
inches and produces musical sounds. The shell of the <i>Tridacna
gigas</i> is the largest anywhere known.</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;For the botanist Java is a natural paradise, affording him
the means of studying the effects of moisture and heat, of air-currents
and altitudes, without the interference of superincumbent
arctic conditions. The botanic gardens of Buitenzorg have long
been famous for their wealth of material, the ability with which
their treasures have been accumulated and displayed, their value
in connexion with the economic development of the island and the
extensive scientific literature published by their directors.<a name="fa10e" id="fa10e" href="#ft10e"><span class="sp">10</span></a> There
is a special establishment at Chibodas open to students of all nations
for the investigation on the spot of the conditions of the primeval
forest. Hardly any similar area in the world has a flora of richer
variety than Java. It is estimated that the total number of the
species of plants is about 5000; but this is probably under the mark
(De Candolle knew of 2605 phanerogamous species), and new genera
and species of an unexpected character are from time to time
discovered. The lower parts of the island are always in the height of
summer. The villages and even the smaller towns are in great
measure concealed by the abundant and abiding verdure; and their
position in the landscape is to be recognized mainly by their groves,
orchards and cultivated fields. The amount and distribution of
heat and moisture at the various seasons of the year form the dominant
factors in determining the character of the vegetation. Thus
trees which are evergreen in west Java are deciduous in the east of
the island, some dropping their leaves (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Tetrameles nudiflora</i>)
at the very time they are in bloom or ripening their fruit. This and
other contrasts are graphically described from personal observation
by A. F. W. Schimper in his <i>Pflanzen-Geographie auf physiologischer
Grundlage</i> (Jena, 1898). The abundance of epiphytes, orchids,
pitcher-plants, mosses and fungi is a striking result of the prevalent
humidity; and many trees and plants indeed, which in drier
climates root in the soil, derive sufficient moisture from their
stronger neighbours. Of orchids J. J. Smith records 562 species
(100 genera), but the flowers of all except about a score are inconspicuous.
This last fact is the more remarkable because, taken
generally, the Javanese vegetation differs from that of many other
tropical countries by being abundantly and often gorgeously
floriferous. Many of the loftiest trees crown themselves with
blossoms and require no assistance from the climbing plants that
seek, as it were, to rival them in their display of colour. Shrubs, too,
and herbaceous plants often give brilliant effects in the savannahs,
the deserted clearings, the edges of the forest and the sides of the
highways. The <i>lantana</i>, a verbenaceous alien introduced, it is
said, from Jamaica by Lady Raffles, has made itself aggressively
conspicuous in many parts of the island, more especially in the
Preanger and middle Java, where it occupies areas of hundreds of
acres.</p>

<p>The effect of mere altitude in the distribution of the flora was
long ago emphasized by Friedrich Junghuhn, the Humboldt of
Java, who divided the island into four vertical botanical zones&mdash;a
division which has generally been accepted by his successors,
though, like all such divisions, it is subject to many modifications
and exceptions. The forest, or hot zone, extends to a height of
2000 ft. above the sea; the second, that of moderate heat, has its
upper limit at about 4500; the third, or cool, zone reaches 7500;
and the fourth, or coldest, comprises all that lies beyond. The
lowest zone has, of course, the most extensive area; the second is
only a fiftieth and the third a five-thousandth of the first; and the
fourth is an insignificant remainder. The lowest is the region of
the true tropical forest, of rice-fields and sugar-plantations, of coco-nut
palms, cotton, sesamum, cinnamon and tobacco (though
this last has a wide altitudinal range). Many parts of the coast
(especially on the north) are fringed with mangrove (<i>Rhizophora
mucronata</i>), &amp;c., and species of <i>Bruguiera</i>; the downs have their
characteristic flora&mdash;convolvulus and <i>Spinifex squarrosus</i> catching
the eye for very different reasons. Farther inland along the seaboard
appear the nipa dwarf palm (<i>Nipa fruticans</i>), the <i>Alsbonia
scholaris</i> (the wood of which is lighter than cork), Cycadacea,
tree-ferns, screw pines (<i>Pandanus</i>), &amp;c. In west Java the gebang
palm (<i>Corypha gebanga</i>) grows in clumps and belts not far from
but never quite close to the coast; and in east Java a similar position
is occupied by the lontar (<i>Borassus flabelliformis</i>), valuable for its
timber, its sago and its sugar, and in former times for its leaves,
which were used as a writing-material. The fresh-water lakes and
ponds of this region are richly covered with Utricularia and various
kinds of lotus (<i>Nymphaea lotus</i>, <i>N. stellata</i>, <i>Nelumbium speciosum</i>,
&amp;c.) interspersed with <i>Pista stratiotes</i> and other floating plants.
Vast prairies are covered with the silvery alang-alang grass broken
by bamboo thickets, clusters of trees and shrubs (<i>Butea frondosa</i>,
<i>Emblica officinalis</i>, &amp;c.) and islands of the taller erigedeh or glagah
(<i>Saccharum spontaneum</i>). Alang-alang (<i>Imperata arundinacea</i>, Cyr.
var. Bentham) grows from 1 to 4 ft. in height. It springs up
wherever the ground is cleared of trees and is a perfect plague to the
cultivator. It cannot hold its own, however, with the ananas, the
kratok (<i>Phaseolus lunatus</i>) or the lantana; and, in the natural
progress of events, the forest resumes its sway except where the
natives encourage the young growth of the grass by annually setting
the prairies on fire. The true forest, which occupies a great part of
this region, changes its character as we proceed from west to east.
In west Java it is a dense rain-forest in which the struggle of existence
is maintained at high pressure by a host of lofty trees and
parasitic plants in bewildering profusion. The preponderance of
certain types is remarkable. Thus of the Moraceae there are in
Java (and mostly here) seven genera with ninety-five species,
eighty-three of which are <i>Ficus</i> (see S. H. Koorders and T. Valeton,
&ldquo;Boomsoorten op Java&rdquo; in <i>Bijdr. Mede. Dep. Landbower</i> (1906).
These include the so-called waringin, several kinds of figs planted as
shade-trees in the parks of the nobles and officials. The Magnoliaceae
and Anonaceae are both numerously represented. In middle
Java the variety of trees is less, a large area being occupied by teak.
In eastern Java the character of the forest is mainly determined by
the abundance of the Casuarina or Chimoro (<i>C. montana</i> and <i>C.
Junghuhniana</i>). Another species, <i>C. equisetifolia</i>, is planted in west
Java as an ornamental tree. These trees are not crowded together
and encumbered with the heavy parasitic growths of the rain-forest;
but their tall stems are often covered with multitudes of small
vermilion fungi. Wherever the local climate has sufficient humidity,
the true rain-forest claims its own. The second of Junghuhn&rsquo;s
zones is the region of, more especially, tea, cinchona and coffee
plantations, of maize and the sugar palm (areng). In the forest
the trees are richly clad with ferns and enormous fungi; there is a
profusion of underwood (<i>Pavetta macrophylla Javanica</i> and <i>salicifolia</i>;
several species of <i>Lasianthus</i>, <i>Boehmarias</i>, <i>Strobilanthus</i>, &amp;c.),
of woody lianas and ratans, of tree ferns (especially Alsophila).
Between the bushes the ground is covered with ferns, lycopods,
tradescantias, Bignoniaceae, species of <i>Aeschynanthus</i>. Of the
lianas the largest is <i>Plectocomia elongata</i>; one specimen of which
was found to have a length of nearly 790 ft. One of the fungi,
<i>Telephora princeps</i>, is more than a yard in diameter. The trees are
of different species from those of the hot zone even when belonging
to the same genus; and new types appear mostly in limited areas.
The third zone, which consists mainly of the upper slopes of volcanic
mountains, but also comprises several plateaus (the Dieng, parts of
the Tengger, the Ijen) is a region of clouds and mists. There are a
considerable number of lakes and swamps in several parts of the
region, and these have a luxuriant environment of grasses, Cyperaceae,
Characeae and similar forms. The taller trees of the region&mdash;oaks,
chestnuts, various Lauraceae, and four or five species of
<i>Podocarpus</i>&mdash;with some striking exceptions, <i>Astronia spectabilis</i>,
&amp;c., are less floriferous than those of the lower zones; but the shrubs
(<i>Rhododendron javanicum</i>, <i>Ardisia javanica</i>, &amp;c.), herbs and parasites
more than make up for this defect. There is little cultivation,
except in the Tengger, where the natives grow maize, rye and
tobacco, and various European vegetables (cabbage, potatoes, &amp;c.),
with which they supply the lowland markets. In western Java one
of the most striking features of the upper parts of this temperate
region is what Schimper calls the &ldquo;absolute dominion of mosses,&rdquo;
associated with the &ldquo;elfin forest,&rdquo; as he quaintly calls it, a perfect
tangle of &ldquo;low, thick, oblique or even horizontal stems,&rdquo; almost
choked to leaflessness by their grey and ghostly burden. Much of
the lower vegetation begins to have a European aspect; violets,
primulas, thalictrums, ranunculus, vacciniums, equisetums, rhododendrons
(<i>Rhod. retusum</i>). The <i>Primula imperialis</i>, found only
on the Pangerango, is a handsome species, prized by specialists.
In the fourth or alpine zone occur such distinctly European forms as
<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i>, <i>Plantago major</i>, <i>Solanum nigrum</i>, <i>Stellaria media</i>;
and altogether the alpine flora contains representatives of no fewer
than thirty-three families. A characteristic shrub is <i>Anaphalis
javanica</i>, popularly called the Javanese edelweiss, which &ldquo;often
entirely excludes all other woody plants.&rdquo;<a name="fa11e" id="fa11e" href="#ft11e"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The tallest and noblest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
of all the trees in the island is the rasamala or liquid-ambar (<i>Altingia
excelsa</i>), which, rising with a straight clean trunk, sometimes 6 ft.
in diameter at the base, to a height of 100 to 130 ft., spreads out into
a magnificent crown of branches and foliage. When by chance a
climbing plant has joined partnership with it, the combination of
blossoms at the top is one of the finest colour effects of the forest.
The rasamala, however, occurs only in the Preanger and in the
neighbouring parts of Bantam and Buitenzorg. Of the other trees
that may be classified as timber&mdash;from 300 to 400 species&mdash;many
attain noble proportions. It is sufficient to mention <i>Calophyllum
inophyllum</i>, which forms fine woods in the south of Bantam, <i>Mimusops
acuminata</i>, <i>Irna glabra</i>, <i>Dalbergia latifolia</i> (sun wood, English
black-wood) in middle and east Java; the rare but splendid <i>Pithecolobium
Junghuhnianum</i>; <i>Schima Noronhae</i>, <i>Bischofia javanica</i>,
<i>Pterospermum javanicum</i> (greatly prized for ship-building), and the
upas-tree. From the economic point of view all these hundreds of
trees are of less importance than <i>Tectona grandis</i>, the jati or teak,
which, almost to the exclusion of all others, occupies about a third
of the government forest-lands. It grows best in middle and
eastern Java, preferring the comparatively dry and hot climate of
the plains and lower hills to a height of about 2000 ft. above the
sea, and thriving best in more or less calciferous soils. In June it
sheds its leaves and begins to bud again in October. Full-grown
trees reach a height of 100 to 150 ft. In 1895 teak (with a very
limited quantity of other timber) was felled to the value of about
£101,800, and in 1904 the corresponding figure was about £119,935.</p>

<p>That an island which has for so long maintained a dense and growing
population in its more cultivable regions should have such
extensive tracts of primeval or quasi-primeval forest as have been
above indicated would be matter of surprise to one who did not
consider the simplicity of the life of the Javanese. They require
but little fuel; and both their dwellings and their furniture are
mostly constructed of bamboo supplemented with a palm or two.
They destroy the forest mainly to get room for their rice-fields and
pasture for their cattle. In doing this, however, they are often
extremely reckless and wasteful; and if it had not been for the
unusual humidity of the climate their annual fires would have
resulted in widespread conflagrations. As it is, many mountains
are now bare which within historic times were forested to the top;
but the Dutch government has proved fully alive to the danger of
denudation. The state has control of all the woods and forests of
the island with the exception of those of the Preanger, the &ldquo;particular
lands,&rdquo; and Madura; and it has long been engaged in replanting
with native trees and experimenting with aliens from other parts
of the world&mdash;<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>, the juar, <i>Cassia florida</i> from
Sumatra, the surian (<i>Cedrela febrifuga</i>), &amp;c. The greatest success
has been with cinchona.</p>

<p>Left to itself Java would soon clothe itself again with even a
richer natural vegetation than it had when it was first occupied by
man. The open space left by the demolition of the fortifications on
Nusa Kambangan was in twenty-eight years densely covered by
thousands of shrubs and trees of about twenty varieties, many of the
latter 80 ft. high. Resident Snijthoff succeeded about the close
of the 19th century in re-afforesting a large part of Mount Muriå by
the simple expedient of protecting the territory he had to deal
with from all encroachments by natives.<a name="fa12e" id="fa12e" href="#ft12e"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>
</div>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population of Java (including Madura, &amp;c.)
was 30,098,008 in 1905. In 1900 it was 28,746,688; in 1890,
23,912,564; and in 1880, 19,794,505. The natives consist of the
Javanese proper, the Sundanese and the Madurese. All three
belong to the Malay stock. Between Javanese and Sundanese
the distinction is mainly due to the influence of the Hindus
on the former and the absence of this on the latter. Between
Javanese and Madurese the distinction is rather to be ascribed
to difference of natural environment. The Sundanese have best
retained the Malay type, both in physique and fashion of life.
They occupy the west of the island. The Madurese area,
besides the island of Madura and neighbouring isles, includes the
eastern part of Java itself. The residencies of Tegal, Pekalongan,
Banyumas, Bagelen, Kedu, Semarang, Japara, Surakarta,
Jokjakarta, Rembang, Madiun, Kediri and Surabaya have an
almost purely Javanese population. The Javanese are the most
numerous and civilized of the three peoples.</p>

<p>The colour of the skin in all three cases presents various
shades of yellowish-brown; and it is observed that, owing perhaps
to the Hindu strain, the Javanese are generally darker than
the Sundanese. The eyes are always brown or black, the hair of
the head black, long, lank and coarse. Neither breast nor limbs
are provided with hair, and there is hardly even the suggestion
of a beard. In stature the Sundanese is less than the Javanese
proper, being little over 5 ft. in average height, whereas the
Javanese is nearly 5½ ft.; at the same time the Sundanese is more
stoutly built. The Madurese is as tall as the Javanese, and as
stout as the Sundanese. The eye is usually set straight in the
head in the Javanese and Madurese; among the Sundanese it is
often oblique. The nose is generally flat and small, with wide
nostrils, although among the Javanese it not infrequently becomes
aquiline. The lips are thick, yet well formed; the teeth
are naturally white, but often filed and stained. The cheek-bones
are well developed, more particularly with the Madurese. In
expressiveness of countenance the Javanese and Madurese are
far in advance of the Sundanese. The women are not so well
made as the men, and among the lower classes especially soon
grow absolutely ugly. In the eyes of the Javanese a golden
yellow complexion is the perfection of female beauty. To judge
by their early history, the Javanese must have been a warlike
and vigorous people, but now they are peaceable, docile, sober,
simple and industrious.</p>

<p>One million only out of the twenty-six millions of natives are
concentrated in towns, a fact readily explained by their sources
of livelihood. The great bulk of the population is distributed
over the country in villages usually called by Europeans dessas,
from the Low Javanese word <i>déså</i> (High Javanese <i>dusun</i>). Every
dessa, however small (and those containing from 100 to 1000
families are exceptionally large), forms an independent community;
and no sooner does it attain to any considerable size than
it sends off a score of families or so to form a new dessa. Each
lies in the midst of its own area of cultivation. The general
enceinte is formed by an impervious hedge of bamboos 40 to
70 ft. high. Within this lie the houses, each with its own enclosure,
which, even when the fields are the communal property,
belongs to the individual householder. The capital of a district
is only a larger dessa, and that of a regency has the same general
type, but includes several kampongs or villages. The bamboo
houses in the strictly Javanese districts are always built on the
ground; in the Sunda lands they are raised on piles. Some of
the well-to-do, however, have stone houses. The principal
article of food is rice; a considerable quantity of fish is eaten,
but little meat. Family life is usually well ordered. The upper
class practise polygamy, but among the common people a man
has generally only one wife. The Javanese are nominally
Mahommedans, as in former times they were Buddhists and
Brahmins; but in reality, not only such exceptional groups as
the Kalangs of Surakarta and Jokjakarta and the Baduwis or
nomad tribes of Bantam, but the great mass of the people must
be considered as believers rather in the primitive animism of
their ancestors, for their belief in Islam is overlaid with superstition.
As we ascend in the social scale, however, we find the
name of Mahommedan more and more applicable; and consequently
in spite of the paganism of the populace the influence of
the Mahommedan &ldquo;priests&rdquo; (this is their official title in Dutch)
is widespread and real. Great prestige attaches to the pilgrimage
to Mecca, which was made by 5068 persons from Java in
1900. In every considerable town there is a mosque. Christian
missionary work is not very widely spread.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Languages.</i>&mdash;In spite of Sundanese, Madurese and the intrusive
Malay, Javanese has a right to the name. It is a rich and cultivated
language which has passed through many stages of development
and, under peculiar influences, has become a linguistic complex
of an almost unique kind. Though it is customary and convenient
to distinguish New Javanese from Kavi or Old Javanese, just as it
was customary to distinguish English from Anglo-Saxon, there is no
break of historical continuity. Kavi (Basa Kavi, <i>i.e.</i> the language
of poetry) may be defined as the form spoken and written before the
founding of Majapahit; and middle Javanese, still represented by
the dialect of Banyumas, north Cheribon, north Krawang and
north Bantam, as the form the language assumed under the Majapahit
court influence; while New Javanese is the language as it has
developed since the fall of that kingdom. Kavi continued to be a
literary language long after it had become archaic. It contains
more Sanskrit than any other language of the archipelago. New
Javanese breaks up into two great varieties, so different that sometimes
they are regarded as two distinct languages. The nobility
use one form, Kråmå; the common people another, Ngoko, the
&ldquo;thouing&rdquo; language (cf. Fr. <i>tutoyant</i>, Ger. <i>dutzend</i>); but each class
understands the language of the other class. The aristocrat speaks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
to the commonalty in the language of the commoner; the commoner
speaks to the aristocracy in the language of the aristocrat; and,
according to clearly recognized etiquette, every Javanese plays the
part of aristocrat or commoner towards those whom he addresses.
To speak Ngoko to a superior is to insult him; to speak Kråmå to an
equal or inferior is a mark of respect. In this way Dipå Negårå
showed his contempt for the Dutch General de Kock. The ordinary
Javanese thinks in Ngoko; the children use it to each other, and so on.
Between the two forms there is a kind of compromise, the Madya,
or middle form of speech, employed by those who stand to each
other on equal or friendly footing or by those who feel little constraint
of etiquette. For every idea expressed in the language Kråmå has
one vocable, the Ngoko another, the two words being sometimes
completely different and sometimes differing only in the termination,
the beginning or the middle. Thus every Javanese uses, as it were,
two or even three languages delicately differentiated from each
other. How this state of affairs came about is matter of speculation.
Almost certainly the existence side by side of two peoples, speaking
each its own tongue, and occupying towards each other the position
intellectually and politically of superior and inferior, had much to
do with it. But Professor Kern thinks that some influence must
also be assigned to <i>pamela</i> or <i>pantang</i>, word-taboo&mdash;certain words
being in certain circumstances regarded as of evil omen&mdash;a superstition
still lingering, <i>e.g.</i> even among the Shetland fishermen (see
G. A. F. Hazeu, <i>De taal pantangs</i>). It has sometimes been asserted
that Kråmå contains more Sanskrit words than Ngoko does; but
the total number in Kråmå does not exceed 20; and sometimes
there is a Sanskrit word in Ngoko which is not in Kråmå. There
is a village Kråmå which is not recognized by the educated classes:
Kråmå inggil, with a vocabulary of about 300 words, is used in
addressing the deity or persons of exalted rank. The Basa Kedaton
or court language is a dialect used by all living at court except
royalties, who use Ngoko. Among themselves the women of the
court employ Kråmå or Madya, but they address the men in Basa
Kedaton.<a name="fa13e" id="fa13e" href="#ft13e"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

<p><i>Literature.</i>&mdash;Though a considerable body of Kavi literature is still
extant, nothing like a history of it is possible. The date and authorship
of most of the works are totally unknown. The first place may
be assigned to the <i>Brata Yuda</i> (Sansk., <i>Bharata Yudha</i>, the conflict
of the Bharatas), an epic poem dealing with the struggle between the
Pandåwås and the Koråwas for the throne of Ngastina celebrated
in parwas 5-10 of the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>. To the conception, however, of
the modern Javanese it is a purely native poem; its kings and heroes
find their place in the native history and serve as ancestors to
their noble families. (Cohen Stuart published the modern Javanese
version with a Dutch translation and notes, <i>Bråtå-Joedå</i>, &amp;c.,
Samarang, 1877. The Kavi text was lithographed at the Hague
by S. Lankhout.) Of greater antiquity probably is the <i>Ardjunå
Wiwåhå</i> (or marriage festival of Ardjuna), which Professor Kern
thinks may be assigned to the first half of the 11th century of the
Christian era. The name indicates its <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> origin. (Friederich
published the Kavi text from a Bali MS., and <i>Wiwåhå Djarwa
en Bråtå Joedo Kawi</i>, lithographed facsimiles of two palm-leaf MSS.,
Batavia, 1878. Djarwa is the name of the poetic diction of modern
Javanese.) The oldest poem of which any trace is preserved is
probably the mythological <i>Kåndå</i> (<i>i.e.</i> tradition); the contents are
to some extent known from the modern Javanese version. In the
literature of modern Javanese there exists a great variety of so-called
<i>babads</i> or chronicles. It is sufficient to mention the &ldquo;history&rdquo;
of Baron Sakender, which appears to give an account&mdash;often hardly
recognizable&mdash;of the settlement of Europeans in Java (Cohen
Stuart published text and translation, Batavia, 1851; J. Veth gives an
analysis of the contents), and the <i>Babad Tanah Djawi</i> (the Hague,
1874, 1877), giving the history of the island to 1647 of the Javanese
era. Even more numerous are the <i>wayangs</i> or puppet-plays which
usually take their subjects from the Hindu legends or from those
relating to the kingdoms of Majapahit and Pajajaram (see <i>e.g.</i> H. C.
Humme, <i>Abiåså, een Javaansche toneelstuk</i>, the Hague, 1878). In
these plays grotesque figures of gilded leather are moved by the
performer, who recites the appropriate speeches and, as occasion
demands, plays the part of chorus.</p>

<p>Several Javanese specimens are also known of the beast fable,
which plays so important a part in Sanskrit literature (W. Palmer
van den Broek, <i>Javaansche Vertellingen, bevattende de lotgevallen
van een kantjil, een reebok</i>, &amp;c., the Hague, 1878). To the Hindu-Javanese
literature there naturally succeeded a Mahommedan-Javanese
literature consisting largely of translations or imitations
of Arabic originals; it comprises religious romances, moral exhortations
and mystical treatises in great variety.<a name="fa14e" id="fa14e" href="#ft14e"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p><i>Arts.</i>&mdash;In mechanic arts the Javanese are in advance of the other
peoples of the archipelago. Of thirty different crafts practised among
them, the most important are those of the blacksmith or cutler, the
carpenter, the kris-sheath maker, the coppersmith, the goldsmith
and the potter. Their skill in the working of the metals is the more
noteworthy as they have to import the raw materials. The most
esteemed product of the blacksmith&rsquo;s skill is the kris; every man and
boy above the age of fourteen wears one at least as part of his ordinary
dress, and men of rank two and sometimes four. In the finishing
and adornment of the finer weapons no expense is spared;
and ancient krises of good workmanship sometimes fetch enormous
prices. The Javanese gold and silver work possesses considerable
beauty, but there is nothing equal to the filigree of Sumatra; the
brass musical instruments are of exceptional excellence. Both
bricks and tiles are largely made, as well as a coarse unglazed
pottery similar to that of Hindustan; but all the finer wares are
imported from China. Cotton spinning, weaving and dyeing are
carried on for the most part as purely domestic operations by the
women. The usual mode of giving variety of colour is by weaving
in stripes with a succession of different coloured yarns, but another
mode is to cover with melted wax or damar the part of the cloth not
intended to receive the dye. This process is naturally a slow one,
and has to be repeated according to the number of colours required.
As a consequence the <i>battiks</i>, as the cloths thus treated are called,
are in request by the wealthier classes. For the most part quiet
colours are preferred. To the Javanese of the present day the ancient
buildings of the Hindu periods are the work of supernatural power.
Except when employed by his European master he seldom builds
anything more substantial than a bamboo or timber framework;
but in the details of such erections he exhibits both skill and taste.
When Europeans first came to the island they found native vessels
of large size well entitled to the name of ships; and, though ship-building
proper is now carried on only under the direction of Europeans,
boat-building is a very extensive native industry along the
whole of the north coast&mdash;the boats sometimes reaching a burden
of 50 tons. The only one of the higher arts which the Javanese
have carried to any degree of perfection is music; and in regard
to the value of their efforts in this direction Europeans differ
greatly. The orchestra (<i>gamelan</i>) consists of wind, string and
percussion instruments, the latter being in preponderancy to the
other two. (Details of the instruments will be found in Raffles&rsquo;
<i>Java</i>, and a description of a performance in the <i>Tour du monde</i>,
1880.)</p>

<p><i>Chief Towns and Places of Note.</i>&mdash;The capital of Java and of the
Dutch East India possessions is Batavia (<i>q.v.</i>), pop. 115,567. At
Meester Cornelis (pop. 33,119), between 6 and 7 m. from Batavia
on the railway to Buitenzorg, the battle was fought in 1811 which
placed Java in the hands of the British. In the vicinity lies Depok,
originally a Christian settlement of freed slaves, but now with about
3000 Mahommedan inhabitants and only 500 Christians. The
other chief towns, from west to east through the island, are as
follows: Serang (pop. 5600) bears the same relation to Bantam, about
6 m. distant, which New Batavia bears to Old Batavia, its slight
elevation of 100 ft. above the sea making it fitter for European
occupation. Anjer (Angerlor, Anger) lies 96 m. from Batavia by
rail on the coast at the narrowest part of the Sunda Strait; formerly
European vessels were wont to call there for fresh provisions and
water. Pandeglang (pop. 3644), 787 ft. above sea-level, is known
for its hot and cold sulphur springs. About 17 m. west of Batavia
lies Tangerang (pop. 13,535), a busy place with about 2800 or 3000
Chinese among its inhabitants. Buitenzorg (<i>q.v.</i>) is the country-seat
of the governor-general, and its botanic gardens are famous.
Krawang, formerly chief town of the residency of that name&mdash;the
least populous of all&mdash;has lost its importance since Purwakerta
(pop. 6862) was made the administrative centre. At Wanyasa in
the neighbourhood the first tea plantations were attempted on a
large scale.</p>

<p>The Preanger regencies&mdash;Bandung, Chanjur, Sukabumi, Sumedang,
Garut and Tasikmalaya&mdash;constitute the most important of all the
residencies, though owing to their lack of harbour on the south and
the intractable nature of much of their soil they have not shared
in the prosperity enjoyed by many other parts of the island. Bandung,
the chief town since 1864, lies 2300 ft. above sea-level, 109 m.
south of Batavia by rail; it is a well-built and flourishing place
(pop. 28,965; Europeans 1522, Chinese 2650) with a handsome
resident&rsquo;s house (1867), a large mosque (1867), a school for the sons
of native men of rank, the most important quinine factory in the
island, and a race-course where in July a good opportunity is afforded
of seeing both the life of fashionable and official Java and the
customs and costumes of the common people. The district is
famous for its waterfalls, one of the most remarkable of which is
where the Chi Tarum rushes through a narrow gully to leap down
from the Bandung plateau. In the neighbourhood is the great
military camp of Chimahi. Chanjur, formerly the chief town, in
spite of its loss of administrative position still has a population of
13,599. From Sukabumi (pop. 12,112; 569 Europeans), a pleasant
health resort among the hills at an altitude of 1965 ft., tourists are
accustomed to visit Wijnkoopers Bay for the sake of the picturesque
shore scenery. Chichalengka became after 1870 one of the centres
of the coffee industry. Sumedang has only 8013 inhabitants,
having declined since the railway took away the highway traffic: it
is exceeded both by Garut (10,647) and by Tasikmalaya (9196), but
it is a beautiful place well known to sportsmen for its proximity to
the Rancha Ekek swamp, where great snipe-shooting matches are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
held every year. For natural beauty few parts of Java can compare
with the plain of Tasikmalaya, itself remarkable, in a country of
trees, for its magnificent avenues. N.E. of the Preanger lies the
residency of Cheribon<a name="fa15e" id="fa15e" href="#ft15e"><span class="sp">15</span></a> (properly Chi Rebon, the shrimp river).
The chief town (pop. 24,564) is one of the most important places
on the north coast, though the unhealthiness of the site has
caused Europeans to settle at Tangkil, 2 m. distant. The church
(1842), the regent&rsquo;s residence, and the great prison are among the
principal buildings; there are also extensive salt warehouses. The
native part of the town is laid out more regularly than is usual, and
the Chinese quarter (pop. 3352) has the finest Chinese temple in
Java. The palaces of the old sultans of Cheribon are less extensive
than those of Surakarta and Jokjakarta. Though the harbour has
to be kept open by constant dredging the roadstead is good all the
year round. A strange pleasure palace of Sultan Supeh, often
described by travellers, lies about 2 m. off near Sunya Raja.
Mundu, a village 4 m. south-east of Cheribon, is remarkable as the
only spot on the north coast of the island visited by the ikan prut or
belly-fish, a species about as large as a cod, caught in thousands and
salted by the local fishermen. Indramayu, which lies on both banks
of the Chi Manuk about 8 m. from the coast, is mentioned under
the name of Dermayo as a port for the rice of the district and the
coffee of the Preanger. The coffee trade is extinct but the rice
trade is more flourishing than ever, and the town has 13,400 inhabitants,
of whom 2200 are Chinese. It might have a great commercial
future if money could be found for the works necessary to overcome
the disadvantage of its position&mdash;the roads being safe only during
the east monsoon and the river requiring to be deepened and regulated.
Tegal has long been one of the chief towns of Java: commerce,
native trade and industry, and fisheries are all well represented
and the sugar factories give abundant employment to the
inhabitants. The harbour has been the object of various improvements
since 1871. The whole district is densely populated (3100
to the sq. m.) and the town proper with its 16,665 inhabitants is
surrounded by extensive kampongs (Balapulang, Lebaksiu, &amp;c.).
In Pekalongan (pop. 38,211) and Batang (21,286) the most important
industry is the production of battiks and stamped cloths; there
are also iron-works and sugar factories. The two towns are only
some 5 m. apart. The former has a large mosque, a Protestant
church, an old fort and a large number of European houses. The
Chinese quarters consist of neat stone or brick buildings. Pekalongan
smoked ducks are well known. Brebes (13,474) on the
Pamali is an important trade centre. Banyumas (5000) is the seat
of a resident; it is exceeded by Purwokerto (12,610), Purbalinggo
(12,094) and Chilachap (12,000). This last possesses the best
harbour on the south coast, and but for malaria would have been
an important place. It was chosen as the seat of a great military
establishment but had to be abandoned, the fort being blown up
in 1893. Semarang (pop. 89,286, of whom 4800 are Europeans
and 12,372 Chinese) lies on the Kali Ngaran near the centre of the
north coast. Up to 1824 the old European town was surrounded
by a wall and ditch. It was almost the exact reproduction of a
Dutch town without the slightest accommodation to the exigencies
of the climate, the streets narrow and irregular. The modern town
is well laid out. Among the more noteworthy buildings of Semarang
are the old Prince of Orange fort, the resident&rsquo;s house, the
Roman Catholic church, the Protestant church, the mosque, the
military hospital. A new impulse to the growth of the town was
given by the opening of the railway to Surakarta and Jokjakarta
in 1875. As a seaport the place is unfortunately situated. The
river has long been silted up; the roadstead is insecure in the west
monsoon. After many delays an artificial canal, begun in 1858,
became available as a substitute for the river; but further works
are necessary. A second great canal to the east, begun in 1896,
helps to prevent inundations and thus improve the healthiness of
the town. Demak, 13 m. N.E. of Semarang, though situated in a
wretched region of swamps and having only 5000 inhabitants, is
famous in ancient Javanese history. The mosque, erected by the
first sultan of Demak, was rebuilt in 1845; only a small part of the
old structure has been preserved, but as a sanctuary it attracts
6000 or 7000 pilgrims annually. To visit Demak seven times has
the same ceremonial value as the pilgrimage to Mecca. The tombs
of several of the sultans are still extant. Salatiga (&ldquo;three stones,&rdquo;
with allusion to three temples now destroyed) was in early times one
of the resting places of ambassadors proceeding to the court of Mataram,
and in the European history of Java its name is associated
with the peace of 1755 and the capitulation of 1811. It is the seat
of a cavalry and artillery camp. Its population, about 10,000,
seems to be declining. Ambarawa with its railway station is, on
the other hand, rapidly increasing. Its population of 14,745
includes 459 Europeans. About a mile to the N. lies the fortress
of Willem I. which Van den Bosch meant to make the centre of the
Javanese system of defensive works; the Banyubiru military camp
is in the neighbourhood. Kendal (15,000) is a centre of the sugar
industry. Kudus (31,000; 4300 Chinese) has grown to be one of
the most important inland towns. Its cloth and battik pedlars are
known throughout the island and the success of their enterprise is
evident in the style of their houses. A good trade is also carried on
in cattle, kapok, copra, pottery and all sorts of small wares. The
mosque in the old town has interesting remains of Majapahit
architecture; and the tomb of Pangeran Kudus is a noted Mahommedan
sanctuary. A steam tramway leads northward towards, but
does not reach Japara, which in the 17th century was the chief
port of the kingdom of Mataram and retained its commercial
importance till the Dutch Company removed its establishment to
Semarang. In 1818 Daendels transferred its resident to Pati.
Ungaran, 1026 ft. above the sea, was a place of importance as early
as the 17th century, and in modern times has become known as a
sanatorium. Rembang, a well-built coast town and the seat of a
resident, has grown rapidly to have a population of 29,538 with 210
Europeans. Very similar to each other are Surakarta or Solo and
Jokjakarta, the chief towns of the quasi-independent states or
Vorstenlanden. Surakarta (pop. 109,459; Chinese 5159, Europeans
1913) contains the palace (Kraton, locally called the Bata bumi)
of the susuhunan (which the Dutch translated as emperor), the
dalem of Prince Mangku Negårå, the residences of the Solo nobles,
a small Dutch fort (Vastenburg), a great mosque, an old Dutch
settlement, and a Protestant church. Here the susuhunan lives in
Oriental pomp and state. To visitors there are few more interesting
entertainments than those afforded by the celebration of the 31st
of August (the birthday of the queen of the Netherlands) or of the
New Year and the Puasa festivals, with their wayungs, ballet-dancers,
and so on. Jokjakarta (35 m. S.) has been a great city
since Mangku Bumi settled there in 1755. The Kraton has a circuit
of 3½ m., and is a little town in itself with the palace proper, the
residences of the ladies of the court and kampongs for the hereditary
smiths, carpenters, sculptors, masons, payong-makers, musical
instrument makers, &amp;c., &amp;c., of his highness. The independent Prince
Paku Alam has a palace of his own. As in Surakarta there are an
old Dutch town and a fort. The Jogka market is one of the most
important of all Java, especially for jewelry. The total population
is 72,235 with 1424 Europeans. To the south-east lies Pasar Gedeh,
a former capital of Mataram, with tombs of the ancient princes in
the Kraton, a favourite residence of wealthy Javanese traders.
Surabaya (<i>q.v.</i>), on the strait of Madura, is the largest commercial
town in Java. Its population increased from 118,000 in 1890 to
146,944 in 1900 (8906 Europeans). To the north lies Grissee or
Gresih (25,688 inhabitants) with a fairly good harbour and of special
interest in the early European history of Java. Inland is the
considerable town of Lamongan (12,485 inhabitants). Fifteen m.
S. by rail lies Sidoarjo (10,207; 185 Europeans), the centre of one of
the most densely populated districts and important as a railway
junction. In the neighbourhood is the populous village of Mojosari.
Pasuruan was until modern times one of the chief commercial
towns in Java, the staple being sugar. Since the opening of the
railway to Surabaya it has greatly declined, and its warehouses and
dwelling-houses are largely deserted. The population is 27,152
with 663 Europeans. Probolinggo (called by the natives Banger)
is a place of 13,240 inhabitants. The swampy tracts in the vicinity
are full of fishponds. The baths of Banyubiru (blue water) to the
south have Hindu remains much visited by devotees. Pasirian in
the far south of the residency is a considerable market town and the
terminus of a branch railway. Besuki, the easternmost of all the
residencies, contains several places of some importance; the chief
town Bondowoso (8289); Besuki, about the same size, but with no
foreign trade; Jember, a small but rapidly increasing place, and
Banyuwangi (17,559). This last was at one time the seat of the
resident, now the eastern terminus of the railway system, and is a
seaport on the Bali Strait with an important office of the telegraph
company controlling communication with Port Darwin and Singapore.
It has a very mingled population, besides Javanese and
Madurese, Chinese and Arabs, Balinese, Buginese and Europeans.
The chief town of Kediri (10,489) is the only residency town in the
interior traversed by a navigable river, and is exceeded by Tulungagung;
and the residency of Madiun has two considerable centres of
population: Madiun (21,168) and Ponorogo (16,765).</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;About 40% of the soil of Java is under cultivation.
Bantam and Besuki have each 16% of land under cultivation;
Krawang, 21%; Preanger, 23%; Rembang, 30%; Japara, 62%;
Surabaya, 65%; Kedu, 66%; Samarang, 67%. Proceeding along
the south coast from its west end, we find that in Bantam all the
land cultivated on its south shore amounts to at most but 5% of
that regency; in Preanger and Banyumas, as far as Chilachap, the
land under cultivation amounts at a maximum to 20%. East of
Surakarta the percentages of land on the south coast under cultivation
decline from 30 to 20 and 10. East of the residency of Probolinggo
the percentage of land cultivated on the south coast sinks
to as low as 2. On the north coast, in Krawang and Rembang, with
their morasses and double chains of chalk, there are districts with
only 20% and 10% of the soil under cultivation. In the residencies,
on the other hand, of Batavia, Cheribon, Tegal, Samarang, Japara,
Surabaya and Pasuruan, there are districts having 80% to 90% of
soil, and even more, under cultivation.</p>

<p>The agricultural products of Java must be distinguished into
those raised by the natives for their own use and those raised for
the government and private proprietors. The land assigned to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
natives for their own culture and use amounts to about 9,625,000
acres. In western Java the prevailing crop is rice, less prominently
cultivated in middle Java, while in eastern Java and Madura other
articles of food take the first rank. The Javanese tell strange
legends concerning the introduction of rice, and observe various
ceremonies in connexion with its planting, paying more regard to
them than to the proper cultivation of the cereal. The agricultural
produce grown on the lands of the government and private proprietors,
comprising an area of about 3½ million acres, consists of
sugar, cinchona, coffee, tobacco, tea, indigo, &amp;c. The Javanese
possess buffaloes, ordinary cattle, horses, dogs and cats. The
buffalo was probably introduced by the Hindus. As in agricultural
products, so also in cattle-rearing, western Java is distinguished
from middle and eastern Java. The average distribution of buffaloes
is 106 per 1000 inhabitants, but it varies considerably in different
districts, being greatest in western Java. The fact that rice is the
prevailing culture in the west, while in eastern Java other plants
constitute the chief produce, explains the larger number of buffaloes
found in western Java, these animals being more in requisition in
the culture of rice. The ordinary cattle are of mixed race; the Indian
zebu having been crossed with the banting and with European cattle
of miscellaneous origin. The horses, though small, are of excellent
character, and their masters, according to their own ideas, are
extremely particular in regard to purity of race. Riding comes
naturally to the Javanese; horse-races and tournays have been in
vogue among them from early times.</p>

<p>Coffee is an alien in Java. Specimens brought in 1696 from
Cannanore on the Malabar coast perished in an earthquake and
floods in 1699; the effective introduction of the precious shrub was
due to Hendrik Zwaardekron (see N. P. van den Berg, &ldquo;Voortbrenging
en verbruck van koffie,&rdquo; <i>Tijdschrift v. Nijverh. en Landb.</i> 1879;
and the article &ldquo;Koffie&rdquo; in <i>Encyc. Ned. Ind.</i> Wiji kawih is mentioned in
a Kavi inscription of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 856, and the bean-broth in David Tappen&rsquo;s
list of Javanese beverages, 1667-1682, may have been coffee). The
first consignment of coffee (894 &#8468;) to the Netherlands was made in
1711-1712, but it was not till after 1721 that the yearly exports reached
any considerable amount. The aggregate quantity sold in the
home market from 1711 to 1791 was 2,036,437 piculs, or on an average
about 143 tons per annum; and this probably represented nearly
the whole production of the island. By the beginning of the 19th
century the annual production was about 7143 tons and after the
introduction of the Van den Bosch system of forced culture a further
augmentation was effected. The forced culture system was, in
1909, however, of little importance. Official reports show that
from 1840 to 1873 the amount ranged from 5226 tons to 7354.
During the ten years 1869 to 1878 the average crop of the plantations
under state control was 5226 tons, that of the private planters
about 810. The government has shown a strange reluctance to
surrender the old-fashioned monopoly, but the spirit of private
enterprise has slowly gained the day. Though the appearance of
the coffee blight (<i>Hemileia vastatrix</i>) almost ruined the industry the
planters did not give in. An immune variety was introduced from
Liberia, and scientific methods of treatment have been adopted in
dealing with the plantations. In 1887, a record year, the value of
the coffee crop reached £3,083,333, and at its average it was about
£1,750,000 between 1886 and 1895. The value was only £1,166,666
in 1896. The greatest difficulties are the uncertainties both of the
crop and of its marketable value. The former is well shown in
the figures for 1903 to 1905; government 17,900, 3949 and 3511
tons, and private planters 22,395, 15,311 and 21,395 tons. Liberia
coffee is still produced in much smaller quantity than Java coffee;
the latter on an average of these three years 21,360 tons; the former
7409.</p>

<p>The cultivation of sugar has been long carried on in Java, and
since the decline of the coffee plantations it has developed into the
leading industry of the island. There are experimental stations at
Pasuruan, Pekalongan and elsewhere, where attempts are made to
overcome the many diseases to which the cane is subject. Many of
the mills are equipped with high-class machinery and produce
sugar of excellent colour and grain. In 1853-1857 the average crop
was 98,094 tons; in 1869-1873, 170,831, and in 1875-1880, 204,678.
By 1899-1900 the average had risen to 787,673 tons; and the crops
for 1904 and 1905 were respectively 1,064,935 and 1,028,357 tons.
Prices fluctuate, but the value of the harvest of 1905 was estimated
at about £15,000,000.</p>

<p>The cultivation of indigo shows a strange vitality. Under the
culture system the natives found this the most oppressive of all the
state crops. The modern chemist at one time seemed to have
killed the industry by his synthetic substitute, but in every year
between 1899 and 1904 Java exported between one million and one
and a half million pounds of the natural product. Japan and Russia
were the largest buyers. As blue is a favourite colour with the
Javanese proper a large quantity is used at home.</p>

<p>Tea was first introduced to Java by the Japanese scholar von
Siebold in 1826. The culture was undertaken by the state in 1829
with plants from China, but in 1842 they handed it over to contractors,
whose attempts to increase their profits by delivering an
inferior article ultimately led to the abandonment of the contract
system in 1860. In the meantime the basis of a better state of the
industry had been laid by the Dutch tea-taster J. J. L. L. Jacobsen
of the Nederlandsch Handel Maatschappij, who introduced not only
fresh stock, but expert growers from China in 1852-1853. The tea-planters
(often taking possession of the abandoned coffee-plantations)
have greatly improved the quality of their products. Assam
tea was introduced in 1878, and this has rapidly extended its area.
The exports increased from 12,110,724 &#8468; in 1898 to 25,772,564 in
1905. More than half the total goes to the Netherlands; the United
Kingdom ranks next, and, far behind both, Russia.</p>

<p>In 1854 the government introduced the culture of cinchona with
free labour, and it had considerable success under F. Junghuhn and
his successors, though the varieties grown were of inferior quality.
Later seed of the best cinchona was obtained, and under skilful
management Java has become the chief producer of quinine in the
world. Cacao is produced in the Preanger regencies, Pekalongan,
Semarang, Pasuruan, Besuki, Kediri and Surakarta. In 1903, a
record year, 1,101,835 piculs (about 6540 tons) were produced.
<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i> is grown for the sake of its bark, so well
known in Japan (Jap. <i>kodsu</i>) as a paper material. The ground-nut
(the widely spread <i>Arachis hypogaea</i> from South America), locally
known as kachang china or tanah, is somewhat extensively grown.
The oil is exported to Holland, where it is sold as Delft salad oil.
Tapioca has long been cultivated, especially in the Preanger. The
industry is mainly in the hands of the Chinese, and the principal
foreign purchasers are English biscuit manufacturers. The kapok is a
tree from tropical America which, growing freely in any soil, is extensively
used throughout Java along the highways as a support for
telegraph and telephone wires, and planted as a prop in pepper and
cubeb plantations. The silky fibre contained in its long capsuloid
fruits is known as cotton wool; and among other uses it
serves almost as well as cork for filling life-belts; and the oil from its
seed is employed to adulterate ground-nut oil. The quantity of
wool exported nearly trebled between 1890 and 1896, in the latter
year the total sent to Holland, Australia, Singapore, &amp;c., amounting
to 38,586 bales. The rapid exhaustion of the natural supply of
india-rubber and gutta-percha began to attract the attention of
government in the latter decades of the 19th century. Extensive
experiments have been made in the cultivation of <i>Ficus elastica</i>
(the karet of the natives), <i>Castilloa elastica</i>, and <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>.
The planting of gutta-percha trees was begun about 1886, and a
regular system introduced in the Preanger in 1901. The <i>Palaquium
oblongifolium</i> plantations at Blavan, Kemutuk and Sewang in
Banyumas have also been brought under official control. Java
tobacco, amounting to about 35,200,000 &#8468; a year, is cultivated
almost exclusively in eastern Java. Among other products which
are of some importance as articles of export may be mentioned
nutmegs, mace, pepper, hides, arrack and copra.</p>

<p><i>Particular Lands.</i>&mdash;At different times down to 1830 the government
disposed of its lands in full property to individuals who,
acquiring complete control of the inhabitants as well as of the soil,
continued down to the 19th century to act as if they were independent
of all superior authority. In this way more than 1½ millions
of the people were subject not to the state but to &ldquo;stock companies,
absentee landlords and Chinese.&rdquo; According to the <i>Regeerings
Almanak</i> (1906) these &ldquo;particular lands,&rdquo; as they are called, were
distributed as follows: Bantam 21, Batavia 36, Meester Cornelis
163, Tangerang 80, Buitenzorg 61, Semarang 32, Surabaya 46,
Krawang and Demak 3 each, Cheribon 2, and Pekalongan, Kendal
and Pasuruan 1 each. In Meester Cornelis no fewer than 297,912
persons were returned in 1905 as living on these lands. Of the 168
estates there are not 20 that grow anything but grass, rice and coconuts.
In Buitenzorg (thanks probably to the Botanic Gardens)
matters are better: tea, coffee, cinchona and india-rubber appearing
amongst the objects of cultivation; and, in general, it must be noted
that these estates have often natural difficulties to contend against
far beyond their financial strength.</p>

<p><i>Minerals.</i>&mdash;Of all the great islands of the archipelago Java is the
poorest in metallic ores. Gold and silver are practically nonexistent.
Manganese is found in Jokjakarta and various other
parts. A concession for working the magnetic iron sands in the
neighbourhood of Chilachap was granted in 1904. Coal occurs in
thin strata and small pockets in many parts (Bantam, Rembang,
Jokjakarta, &amp;c.); and in 1905 a concession was granted to a company
to work the coal-beds at Bajah close to the harbour of Wijnkoopers
Bay, a port of call of the Koninklijk Paketvaart Maatschappij.
The discovery by De Groot in 1863 of petroleum added a most
important industry to the list of the resources of Java. The great
Dort Petroleum Company, now centred at Amsterdam, was founded
in 1887. The production of this company alone rose from 79,179
<i>kisten</i> or cases (each 8.14 gall.) in 1891 to 1,642,780 in 1890, and
to 1,967,124 in 1905. In 1904 there were no fewer than 36 concessions
for petroleum. At the same time there is a larger importation
of oil from Sumatra as well as from America and Russia. Sulphur
is regularly worked in the Gunong Slamet, G. Sindoro, G. Sumbing,
and in the crater of the Tangkuban Prahu as well as in other places
in the Preanger regencies and in Pasuruan. Brine-wells exist in
various parts. The bledegs (salt-mud wells) of Grobogan in the
Solo Valley, Semarang, are best known. They rise from Miocene
strata and yield iodine and bromine products as well as common
salt. The natives of the district are allowed to extract the salt for
their own use, but elsewhere (except in Jokjakarta) the manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
of salt is a government monopoly and confined to the districts of
Sumenep, Panekasan and Sampang in Madura, where from 3000 to
4000 people are hereditarily engaged in extracting salt from sea
water, delivering it to the government at the rate of 10 fl. (nearly
17s.) per koyang (3700 &#8468;). The distribution of this salt (rough-grained,
greyish and highly hygroscopic) is extremely unsatisfactory.
The waste was so great that in 1901 the government paid a prize of
about £835 (10,000 fl.) to Karl Boltz von Bolzberg for an improved
method of packing. Between 1888 and 1892 the annual amount
delivered was 71,405 tons; in the next five years it rose to 89,932;
and between 1898 and 1902 sank again to 88,856. The evil effects
of this monopoly have been investigated by J. E. de Meyer, &ldquo;Zout
als middel van belasting,&rdquo; <i>De Ind. Gids.</i> (1905). The scarcity of salt
has led to a great importation of salted fish from Siam (upwards of
6600 tons in 1902).</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Roads and railways for the most part follow
the fertile plains and table-lands along the coast and between the
volcanic areas. The principal railways are the Semarang-Jokjakarta
and Batavia-Buitenzorg lines of the Netherlands-Indian
railway company, and the Surabaya-Pasuruan, Bangil-Mulang,
Sidoarjo-Paron, Kertosono-Tulung Agung, Buitenzorg-Chianjur,
Surakarta-Madiun, Pasuruan-Probolinggo, Jokjakarta-Chilachap and
other lines of the government. The earliest lines, between Batavia
and Buitenzorg and between Semarang and the capitals of the
sultanates, were built about 1870 by a private company with a state
guarantee. Since 1875, when Dr van Goltstein, then a cabinet
minister and afterwards Dutch minister in London, had an act passed
for the construction of state railways in Java, their progress has
become much more rapid. In addition, several private companies
have built either light railways or tramways, such as that between
Semarang and Joana, and the total length of all lines was 2460 in
1905. There are some 3500 miles of telegraph line, and cables
connect Java with Madura, Bali and Sumatra, and Port Darwin in
Australia. Material welfare was promoted by the establishment
of lines of steamships between Java and the other islands, all
belonging to a Royal Packet Company, established in 1888 under a
special statute, and virtually possessing a monopoly on account of
the government mail contracts.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;Each village (dessa) forms an independent
community, a group of dessas forms a district, a group of districts a
department and a group of departments a residency, of which there
are seventeen. At the head of each residency is a resident, with an
assistant resident and a controller, all Dutch officials. The officials
of the departments and districts are natives appointed by the
government; those of the dessa are also natives, elected by the
inhabitants and approved by the resident. In the two sultanates
of Surakarta and Jokjakarta the native sultans govern under the
supervision of the residents. (For the colonial administration of
Netherlands India see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Malay Archipelago</a></span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The origin of the name Java is very doubtful. It
is not improbable that it was first applied either to Sumatra or
to what was known of the Indian Archipelago&mdash;the insular
character of the several parts not being at once recognized.
Jawa Dwipa, or &ldquo;land of millet,&rdquo; may have been the original
form and have given rise both to the Jaba diu of Ptolemy and to
the Je-pho-thi of Fahien, the Chinese pilgrim of the 4th-5th
century. The oldest form of the name in Arabic is apparently
Zábej. The first epigraphic occurrence of Jawa is in an inscription
of 1343. In Marco Polo the name is the common appellation
of all the Sunda islands. The Jawa of Ibn Batuta is Sumatra;
Java is his Mul Jáwa (<i>i.e.</i> possibly &ldquo;original Java&rdquo;). Jåwå
is the modern Javanese name (in the court speech Jawi), sometimes
with Nusa, &ldquo;island,&rdquo; or Tanah, &ldquo;country,&rdquo; prefixed.</p>

<p>It is impossible to extract a rational historical narrative from
the earlier <i>babads</i> or native chronicles, and even the later are
destitute of any satisfactory chronology. The first great era
in the history is the ascendancy of the Hindus, and that breaks
up into three periods&mdash;a period of Buddhism, a period of
aggressive Sivaism, and a period of apparent compromise. Of
the various Hindu states that were established in the island,
that of Majapahit was the most widely dominant down to the
end of the 15th century; its tributaries were many, and it even
extended its sway into other parts of the archipelago. The
second era of Javanese history is the invasion of Islam in the
beginning of the 15th century; and the third is the establishment
of European and more particularly of Dutch influence and
authority in the island. About 1520 the Portuguese entered
into commercial relationship with the natives, but at the close
of the same century the Dutch began to establish themselves.
At the time when the Dutch East India company began to fix
its trading factories on the coast towns, the chief native state
was Mataram, which had in the 16th century succeeded to the
overlordship possessed by the house of Demak&mdash;one of the
states that rose after the fall of Majapahit. The emperors of
Java, as the princes of Mataram are called in the early accounts,
had their capital at Kartasura, now an almost deserted place,
6 m. west of Surakarta. At first and for long the company had
only forts and little fragments of territory at Jakatra (Batavia),
&amp;c.; but in 1705 it obtained definite possession of the Preanger
by treaty with Mataram; and in 1745 its authority was extended
over the whole north-east coast, from Cheribon to Banyuwangi.
In 1755 the kingdom of Mataram was divided into the two states
of Surakarta and Jokjakarta, which still retain a shadow of
independence. The kingdom of Bantam was finally subjugated
in 1808. By the English occupation of the island (1811-1818)
the European ascendancy was rather strengthened than weakened;
the great Java war (1825-1830), in which Dipå Negårå,
the last Javanese prince, a clever, bold and unscrupulous leader,
struggled to maintain his claim to the whole island, resulted in
the complete success of the Dutch. To subdue him and his
following, however, taxed all the resources of the Dutch Indian
army for a period of five years, and cost it the loss of 15,000
officers and soldiers, besides millions of guilders. Nor did his
great influence die with him when his adventurous career came
to a close in 1855 at Macassar. Many Javanese, who dream of a
restoration of their ancient empire, do not believe even yet that
Dipå Negårå is dead. They are readily persuaded by fanatical
hadjis that their hero will suddenly appear to drive away the
Dutch and claim his rightful heritage. Several times there
have been political troubles in the native states of central Java,
in which Dipå Negårå&rsquo;s name was used, notably in 1883, when
many rebellious chieftains were exiled. Similar attempts at
revolt had been made before, mainly in 1865 and 1870, but none
so serious perhaps as that in 1849, in which a son and a brother
of Dipå Negårå were implicated, aiming to deliver and reinstate
him. All such attempts proved as futile there as others in
different parts of Java, especially in Bantam, where the trouble
of 1850 and 1888 had a religious origin, and in the end they
directly contributed to the consolidation of Dutch sway. Being
the principal Dutch colony in the Malay Archipelago, Java was
the first to benefit from the material change which resulted from
the introduction of the Grondwet or Fundamental Law of 1848
in Holland. The main changes were of an economical character,
but the political developments were also important. Since 1850
Dutch authority has steadily advanced, principally at the expense
of the semi-independent sultanates in central Java, which
had been allowed to remain after the capture and exile of Dipå
Negårå. The power of the sultans of Jokjakarta and Surakarta
has diminished; in 1863 Dutch authority was strengthened
in the neighbouring island of Madura, and Bantam has lost every
vestige of independence. The strengthening of the Dutch power
has largely resulted from a more statesmanlike and more generous
treatment of the natives, who have been educated to regard the
<i>orang blanda</i>, or white man, as their protector against the native
rulers. Thus, in 1866, passports for natives travelling in Java
were abolished by the then governor-general, Dr Sloet van de
Beele, who also introduced many reforms, reducing the <i>corvée</i> in
the government plantations to a minimum, and doing away with
the monopoly of fisheries. Six years later a primary education
system for the natives, and a penal code, whose liberal provisions
seemed framed for Europeans, were introduced.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;Ordinary traces of early human occupation are few
in Java. The native bamboo buildings speedily perish. Stone
weapons are occasionally found. But remains of the temples and
monastic buildings of the Hindu period are numerous and splendid,
and are remarkable as representing architecture which reached a
high standard without the use of mortar, supporting columns or
arches. Chandis (<i>i.e.</i> temples, though the word originally meant a
depository for the ashes of a saint) are not found in western Java.
They exist in two great zones: one in middle Java, one in eastern
Java, each with its own distinguishing characteristics, both architectural
and religious. The former begins in the Dyeng plateau,
in the east of Banyumas, and extends into the east of Bagelen,
Kedu and the neighbouring districts of Semarang, northern Jokjakarta,
and the western corner of Surakarta. The latter lies mainly
in Surabaya, Kediri and Pasuruan. A considerable number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
ruins also exist in Probolinggo. Farther east they grow scarce.
There is none in Madura. The remains of Macham Putih in
Banyuwangi are possibly of non-Hindu origin. In the regency of
Kendal (Semarang), to the north of Kedu, the place-names show that
temples once existed.<a name="fa16e" id="fa16e" href="#ft16e"><span class="sp">16</span></a> Some of them are Sivaite, some Buddhist,
some astoundingly composite. None of the Buddhist buildings
shows traces of the older Himaryana form of the creed. The greatest
of all is a perfect sculptural exposition of the Mahayana doctrine.
As to the period during which these temples were erected, authorities
are not agreed. Ijzerman assigns the central Java groups to between
the 8th and the 10th centuries. The seven-storeyed vihara (monastery)
mentioned in the famous Menang-Kabu inscription (Sumatra)
as founded by Maharaja Dhiraya Adityadharma in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 656 is by
some supposed to be Boro-Budur. A copper plate of 840 refers to
Dyeng (Dehyang) as one of the sacred mountains of Java. One
thing seems certain, that the temples of the eastern zone are of
much more recent origin than most, at least, of the central zone.
They are generally distinguished by the characteristics of a decadent
and more voluptuous age, and show that the art of the time had
become less Indian and more Javanese, with traces of influences
derived from the more eastern East. At the same time it must be
noted that even in Boro Budur there are non-Indian elements in the
decoration, indicating that the Hindu architect employed native
artists and to some extent left them a free hand.</p>

<p>In his standard work on <i>Indian and Eastern Architecture</i> (London,
1876), James Fergusson asserted that the Javanese temples are in
the Chalukyan style. But J. W. Ijzerman in an elaborate paper
in the <i>Album-Kern</i> contends that the learned historian of architecture
was misled by basing his opinion mainly on inaccurate drawings
reproduced by Raffles. The Javanese temples, with the solitary
exception of Chandi Bima in the Dyeng, are Dravidian and not
Chalukyan. The very temples quoted by Fergusson, when more
carefully examined, disprove his statement: a fact not without its
bearing on the history of the Hindu immigration.</p>

<p>The wonderful scenery of the Dyeng plateau was already, in all
probability, an object of superstitious awe to the aboriginal inhabitants
of Java; and thus it would catch the attention of the earliest
Hindu settlers. The old crater floor is full of traces of human
occupation; though, in spite of the tradition of the existence of a
considerable town, no sepulchral relics of the inhabitants have been
discovered. There still remain five groups of temples&mdash;some well
preserved, some mere heaps of stone&mdash;to prove the devotion their
builders bore to Siva, his consort Durga, and Ganesha their son.
The Arjuno group, in the middle of the plateau, consists of Chandi
Arjuno (with its chapel or priests&rsquo; residence, Ch. Semar), Ch. Srikahdi,
Ch. Puntadeva and Ch. Sembadro, each a simple square chamber
with a portico reached by a flight of steps. The second group, Ch.
Daravati and Ch. Parakesit, lies to the north-east. The third, now a
ruined mound, lies to the east. The fourth, to the north-west, is a
group of seven small temples of which Ch. Sanchaki is the most
important, with a square ground plan and an octagon roof with a
second circular storey. Of the fifth group, in the south, only one
temple remains&mdash;the Chandi Bima&mdash;a small, beautiful and exceptionally
interesting building, in &ldquo;the form of a pyramid, the ribs
of which stand out much more prominently than the horizontal
lines of the niche-shaped ornaments which rest each on its lotus
cushion.&rdquo; How this happens to be the one Chalukyan temple
amid hundreds is a problem to be solved. The plateau lies 6500 ft.
above the sea, and roads and stairways, locally known as Buddha
roads, lead up from the lowlands of Bagelen and Pekalongan. The
stairway between Lake Menjur and Lake Chebong alone consisted
of 4700 steps. The width of the roadway, however, is only some three
or four feet. A remarkable subterranean tunnel still exists, which
served to drain the plateau.</p>

<p>Of all the Hindu temples of Java the largest and most magnificent
is Boro-Budur, which ranks among the architectural marvels of the
world. It lies in the residency of Kedu, a little to the west of the
Progo, a considerable stream flowing south to the Indian Ocean.
The place is best reached by taking the steam-tram from Magelang
or Jokjakarta to the village of Muntilam Passar, where a conveyance
may be hired. Strictly speaking, Boro-Budur is not a temple but a
hill, rising about 150 ft. above the plain, encased with imposing
terraces constructed of hewn lava-blocks and crowded with sculptures.
The lowest terrace now above ground forms a square, each
side 497 ft. long. About 50 ft. higher there is another terrace of
similar shape. Then follow four other terraces of more irregular
contour. The structure is crowned by a dome or cupola 52 ft. in
diameter surrounded by sixteen smaller bell-shaped cupolas.
Regarded as a whole, the main design, to quote Mr Sewell, may be
described as &ldquo;an archaic Indian temple, considerably flattened
and consisting of a series of terraces, surmounted by a quasi-stupa
capped by a dagoba.&rdquo; It was discovered by the engineer J. W.
Ijzerman in 1885 that the basement of the structure had been earthed
up before the building was finished, and that the lowest retaining
wall was completely concealed by the embankment. The architects
had evidently found that their temple was threatened with a destructive
subsidence; and, while the sculptors were still busy with
the decoration of the lower façades, they had to abandon their work.
But the unfinished bas-reliefs were carefully protected by clay and
blocks of stone and left in position; and since 1896 they are gradually
but systematically being exhumed and photographed by the Dutch
archaeologists, who, however, have to proceed with caution, filling
up one portion of the embankment before they go on to deal with
another. The subjects treated in this lowest enceinte are of the
most varied description, forming a picture-gallery of landscapes,
scenes of outdoor and domestic life, mingled with mythological and
religious designs. Among the genre class appear men shooting birds
with blow-pipe or bow and arrow, fishermen with rod or net, a man
playing a bagpipe, and so on. It would seem as if the architect had
intended gradually to wean the devotees from the things of this
world. When once they began to ascend from stage to stage of the
temple-hill they were introduced to the realities of religion; and by
the time they reached the dagoba they had passed through a process
of instruction and were ready, with enlightened eyes, to enter and
behold the image of Buddha, symbolically left imperfect, as beyond
the power of human art to realize or portray. From basement to
summit the whole hill is a great picture bible of the Mahayana
creed.</p>

<p>If the statues and bas-reliefs of Boro-Budur were placed side
by side they would extend for 3 m. The eye of the spectator,
looking up from the present ground-level, is caught, says Mr Sewell,
by the rows of life-size Buddhas that adorn the retaining walls of
the several terraces and the cage-like shrines on the circular platforms.
All the great figures on the east side represent Akshobhya,
the Dhyani Buddha of the East. His right hand is in the Chumisparsa
mudra (pose) touching the earth in front of the right knee&mdash;&ldquo;I
swear by the earth.&rdquo; All the statues on the south side are
Ratnasam Chavu in the varada mudra&mdash;the right hand displayed
upwards&mdash;&ldquo;I give you all.&rdquo; On the west side the statues represent
Amitabha in the dhyana or padinasama mudra, the right hand
resting palm upwards on the left, both being on the lap&mdash;the attitude
of meditation. Those on the north represent Amogasiddhi in the
abhaya mudra, the right hand being raised and displayed, palm
outwards&mdash;&ldquo;Fear not, all is well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other remarkable groups of Hindu temples exist near the village
of Prambanan<a name="fa17e" id="fa17e" href="#ft17e"><span class="sp">17</span></a> (less correctly Brambanan) in Surakarta, but not far
from the borders of Jokjakarta, with a station on the railway between
the two chief towns. The village has been named after the temples,
Prambanan signifying the place of teachers. The whole ecclesiastical
settlement was surrounded by three lines of wall, of which
only the inmost is now visible above ground. Between the second
and third walls are 157 small temples, and in the central enclosure
are the ruins of six larger temples in a double row with two smaller
ones at the side. The middle temple of the western row is the main
building, full of statues of purely Sivaite character&mdash;Siva as Guru
or teacher, Siva as Kala or Time the Destroyer, Durga, Ganesha,
and so on. But, just as many churches in Christendom are called
not after the Christ but after the Virgin, so this is known as Lara
(<i>i.e.</i> Virgin) Janggrang from the popular name of Durga. In the
southern temple of the row is a very fine figure of a four-armed
Brahma; in the northern there was a Vishnu with attendant figures.
Of the other row the middle temple is again the largest, with Siva,
his nandi or bull, and other symbolic sculptures. To the north lies
the extraordinary cluster of temples which, though it does not
deserve its popular name of Chandi Sewu, the thousand shrines,
consists of at least 240 small buildings gathered round a great central
temple, richly adorned, though roofless and partially ruined since
the earthquake of 1867. Among the more noteworthy figures are
those of the huge and ungainly guardians of the temple kneeling at
the four main gateways of each of the principal buildings. Colonel
Yule pointed out that there are distinct traces of a fine coat of
stucco on the exterior and the interior of the buildings, and he compared
in this respect &ldquo;the cave walls of Ellora, the great idols at
Bamian, and the Doric order at Selinus.&rdquo; Other temples in the
same neighbourhood as Chandi Sewu are Ch. Lumbung, Ch. Kali
Bening (Baneng), with a monstrous Kala head as the centre of the
design on the southern side, Ch. Kalong and Ch. Plaosan. Tradition
assigns these temples to 1266-1296.</p>

<p>Of the temples of the eastern zone the best known is Chandi Jago
(or Tumpang), elaborately described in the Archaeological Commission&rsquo;s
monograph. According to the <i>Pararaton</i>, a native chronicle
(published in the <i>Verhand. v. h. Bat. Gen. v. K. en W.</i>, 1896), it
belongs to the 13th century, containing the tomb of Rangavuni or
Vishnuvardhana, who died in 1272-1273. The shrine proper
occupies the third of three platforms, the lowest of which forms a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
square of 45 to 46 ft. each side. The building fronts the west, and
is constructed of an andesitic tuff of inferior quality and dark
colour. Of distinctly Buddhistic influence there is no trace.
The makara (elephant-fish head) is notably absent. The sculptures
which run round the base and along the sides of the platforms or
terraces are of the most elaborate and varied description&mdash;kings on
thrones, dwarfs, elephants, supernatural beings, diabolical and
grotesque, tree-monsters, palaces, temples, courtyards, lakes, gardens,
forests&mdash;all are represented. In one place appears a Chinese&mdash;or
Burmese-looking seven-roofed pagoda; in another, a tall temple
strangely split down the centre, with a flight of steps running up the
fissure. The inscriptions are in the Devanagari character. In the
same neighbourhood are Ch. Singossari, Ch. Kidal, &amp;c. Another of
the most beautiful of the eastern temples is Ch. Jabung, mentioned in
1330. It is built of red brick; and its distinctly Javanese origin is
suggested by the frequency of the snake-motif still characteristic
of modern Javanese art. It may be added that a comparison of the
several buildings of the zone affords an interesting study in the
development of the pilaster as a decorative rather than structural
element.</p>

<p>At Panabaram, near Blitar, Kediri, is another group of stone
temples and other buildings. The chief temple is remarkable
for the richness of its sculptures, which are peculiarly delicate and
spirited in their details. The decoration of the mere robes of one
of the free-standing stairway-guardians consists of scroll-work,
interspersed with birds and animals rendered in a non-Indian style,
reminiscent of Chinese or Japanese work. It has been described
as one of the most beautiful pieces of sculpture in all the East.</p>

<p>Sculptures from the temples are scattered far and wide throughout
Java, and it is one of the greatest difficulties of the archaeologist
to determine the origin of many of the most interesting specimens.
This, too, is often the case with those that have found their way
to the museums of Java and Europe (Batavia, Leiden, Haarlem,
Berlin, &amp;c.). Minor relics of the past are to be found alike in the
palaces of the nobles and the huts of the highland peasants. Zodiac
cups of copper or bronze dating from the 12th or 13th century
are in daily use among the Tenggerese. The musical instruments
used by the musicians of the native courts are often prized on
account of their great antiquity.</p>

<p>As many of the Chinese came from China centuries ago and have
not ceased to hold intercourse with their native country, the houses
of the wealthier men among them are often rich in ancient specimens
of Chinese art. The special exhibition organized by Henri Borel
and other enthusiasts showed how much of value in this matter
might be brought together in spite of the reluctance of the owners
to commit the sacrilege of exposing to public gaze the images of
their ancestral gods and heroes. Borel has given exquisite examples
of images of Kwan-yin (the Chinese Virgin-Goddess), of Buddhas, of
the ghoulish god of literature, of Lie-tai-Peh (the Chinese poet who
has gone to live in the planet Venus), &amp;c., in illustration of his papers
in <i>L&rsquo;Art flamand et hollandais</i>, pt. v. (1900), a translation of his
monograph published at Batavia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAVELIN,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> a spear, particularly one light enough to be thrown,
a dart. The javelin was often provided with a thong to help in
casting (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spear</a></span>). Javelin-throwing is one of the contests in
the athletic section at the international Olympic games. Formerly
the sheriff of a county or borough had a body of men
armed with javelins, and known as javelin-men, who acted
as a bodyguard for the judges when they went on assize. Their

<i>Gabel</i>, fork. The change in meaning from fork, forked end

<p><span class="bold">JAY, JOHN<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1745-1829), American statesman, the descendant
of a Huguenot family, and son of Peter Jay, a successful New
York merchant, was born in New York City on the 12th of
December 1745. On graduating at King&rsquo;s College (now Columbia
University) in 1764, Jay entered the office of Benjamin
Kissam, an eminent New York lawyer. In 1768 he was admitted
to the bar, and rapidly acquired a lucrative practice. In 1774
he married Sarah, youngest daughter of William Livingston,
and was thus brought into close relations with one of the most
influential families in New York. Like many other able young
lawyers, Jay took an active part in the proceedings that resulted
in the independence of the United States, identifying himself
with the conservative element in the Whig or patriot party. He
was sent as a delegate from New York City to the Continental
Congress at Philadelphia in September 1774, and though almost
the youngest member, was entrusted with drawing up the
address to the people of Great Britain. Of the second congress,
also, which met at Philadelphia on the 10th of May 1775,
Jay was a member; and on its behalf he prepared an address
to the people of Canada and an address to the people of Jamaica
and Ireland. In April 1776, while still retaining his seat
in the Continental Congress, Jay was chosen as a member of
the third provincial congress of New York; and his consequent
absence from Philadelphia deprived him of the honour of
affixing his signature to the Declaration of Independence.
As a member of the fourth provincial congress he drafted a
resolution by which the delegates of New York in the Continental
Congress were authorized to sign the Declaration of Independence.
In 1777 he was chairman of the committee of the convention
which drafted the first New York state constitution.
After acting for some time as one of the council of safety (which
administered the state government until the new constitution
came into effect), he was made chief justice of New York state,
in September 1777. A clause in the state constitution prohibited
any justice of the Supreme Court from holding any other
post save that of delegate to Congress on a &ldquo;special occasion,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
but in November 1778 the legislature pronounced the secession
of what is now the state of Vermont from the jurisdiction of
New Hampshire and New York to be such an occasion, and
sent Jay to Congress charged with the duty of securing a settlement
of the territorial claims of his state. He took his seat
in congress on the 7th of December, and on the 10th was chosen
president in succession to Henry Laurens.</p>

<p>On the 27th of September 1779 Jay was appointed minister
plenipotentiary to negotiate a treaty between Spain and the
United States. He was instructed to endeavour to bring Spain
into the treaty already existing between France and the United
States by a guarantee that Spain should have the Floridas in
case of a successful issue of the war against Great Britain,
reserving, however, to the United States the free navigation of
the Mississippi. He was also to solicit a subsidy in consideration
of the guarantee, and a loan of five million dollars. His task was
one of extreme difficulty. Although Spain had joined France in
the war against Great Britain, she feared to imperil her own
colonial interests by directly encouraging and aiding the former
British colonies in their revolt against their mother country,
and she had refused to recognize the United States as an independent
power. Jay landed at Cadiz on the 22nd of January
1780, but was told that he could not be received in a formally
diplomatic character. In May the king&rsquo;s minister, Count
de Florida Bianca, intimated to him that the one obstacle to a
treaty was the question of the free navigation of the Mississippi,
and for months following this interview the policy of the
court was clearly one of delay. In February 1781 Congress
instructed Jay that he might make concessions regarding the
navigation of the Mississippi, if necessary; but further delays
were interposed, the news of the surrender of Yorktown arrived,
and Jay decided that any sacrifice to obtain a treaty was no
longer advisable. His efforts to procure a loan were not much
more successful, and he was seriously embarrassed by the action
of Congress in drawing bills upon him for large sums. Although
by importuning the Spanish minister, and by pledging his
personal responsibility, Jay was able to meet some of the bills,
he was at last forced to protest others; and the credit of the
United States was saved only by a timely subsidy from France.</p>

<p>In 1781 Jay was commissioned to act with Franklin, John
Adams, Jefferson and Henry Laurens in negotiating a peace
with Great Britain. He arrived in Paris on the 23rd of June
1782, and jointly with Franklin had proceeded far with the
negotiations when Adams arrived late in October. The instructions
of the American negotiators were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;You are to make the most candid and confidential communications
upon all subjects to the ministers of our generous ally, the
king of France; to undertake nothing in the negotiations for peace
or truce without their knowledge and concurrence; and ultimately
to govern yourselves by their advice and opinion, endeavouring
in your whole conduct to make them sensible how much we rely
on his majesty&rsquo;s influence for effectual support in every thing that
may be necessary to the present security, or future prosperity, of
the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Jay, however, in a letter written to the president of Congress
from Spain, had expressed in strong terms his disapproval of
such dependence upon France, and, on arriving in Paris, he
demanded that Great Britain should treat with his country on
an equal footing by first recognizing its independence, although
the French minister, Count de Vergennes, contended that an
acknowledgment of independence as an effect of the treaty
was as much as could reasonably be expected. Finally,
owing largely to Jay, who suspected the good faith of France,
the American negotiators decided to treat independently with
Great Britain. The provisional articles, which were so favourable
to the United States as to be a great surprise to the courts
of France and Spain, were signed on the 30th of November 1782,
and were adopted with no important change as the final treaty
on the 3rd of September 1783.</p>

<p>On the 24th of July 1784 Jay landed in New York, where he
was presented with the freedom of the city and elected a delegate
to Congress. On the 7th of May Congress had already chosen him
to be secretary for foreign affairs, and in December Jay resigned
his seat in Congress and accepted the secretaryship. He continued
to act in this capacity until 1790, when Jefferson became
secretary of state under the new constitution. In the question of
this constitution Jay had taken a keen interest, and as an
advocate of its ratification he wrote over the name &ldquo;Publius,&rdquo;
five (Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 64) of the famous series of papers known
collectively as the <i>Federalist</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hamilton, Alexander</a></span>). He
published anonymously (though without succeeding in concealing
the authorship) <i>An Address to the People of New York</i>, in vindication
of the constitution; and in the state convention at Poughkeepsie
he ably seconded Hamilton in securing its ratification
by New York. In making his first appointments to federal
offices President Washington asked Jay to take his choice;
Jay chose that of chief justice of the Supreme Court, and held
this position from September 1789 to June 1795. The most
famous case that came before him was that of <i>Chisolm</i> v. <i>Georgia</i>,
in which the question was, Can a state be sued by a citizen
of another state? Georgia argued that it could not be so sued,
on the ground that it was a sovereign state, but Jay decided
against Georgia, on the ground that sovereignty in America
resided with the people. This decision led to the adoption of
the eleventh amendment to the federal constitution, which
provides that no suit may be brought in the federal courts
against any state by a citizen of another state or by a citizen or
subject of any foreign state. In 1792 Jay consented to stand for
the governorship of New York State, but a partisan returning-board
found the returns of three counties technically defective,
and though Jay had received an actual majority of votes, his
opponent, George Clinton, was declared elected.</p>

<p>Ever since the War of Independence there had been friction
between Great Britain and the United States. To the grievances
of the United States, consisting principally of Great Britain&rsquo;s
refusal to withdraw its troops from the forts on the north-western
frontier, as was required by the peace treaty of 1783, her
refusal to make compensation for negroes carried away by the
British army at the close of the War of Independence, her
restrictions on American commerce, and her refusal to enter
into any commercial treaty with the United States, were added,
after war broke out between France and Great Britain in 1793,
the anti-neutral naval policy according to which British naval
vessels were authorized to search American merchantmen and
impress American seamen, provisions were treated as contraband
of war, and American vessels were seized for no other reason than
that they had on board goods which were the property of the
enemy or were bound for a port which though not actually
blockaded was declared to be blockaded. The anti-British
feeling in the House of Representatives became so strong that
on the 7th of April 1794 a resolution was introduced to prohibit
commercial intercourse between the United States and Great
Britain until the north-western posts should be evacuated and
Great Britain&rsquo;s anti-neutral naval policy should be abandoned.
Thereupon Washington, fearing that war might result, appointed
Jay minister extraordinary to Great Britain to negotiate a new
treaty, and the Senate confirmed the appointment by a vote of
18 to 8, although the non-intercourse resolution which came
from the house a few days later was defeated in the senate only
by the casting vote of Vice-President John Adams. Jay landed
at Falmouth in June 1794, signed a treaty with Lord Grenville
on the 19th of November, and disembarked again at New York
on the 28th of May 1795. The treaty, known in history as Jay&rsquo;s
Treaty, provided that the north-western posts should be
evacuated by the 1st of June 1796, that commissioners should be
appointed to settle the north-east and the north-west boundaries,
and that the British claims for British debts as well as the
American claims for compensation for illegal seizures should
be referred to commissioners. More than one-half of the clauses
in the treaty related to commerce, and although they contained
rather small concessions to the United States, they
were about as much as could reasonably have been expected
in the circumstances. One clause, the operation of which
was limited to two years from the close of the existing war,
provided that American vessels not exceeding 70 tons burden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
might trade with the West Indies, but should carry only
American products there and take away to American ports only
West Indian products; moreover, the United States was to
export in American vessels no molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa
or cotton to any part of the world. Jay consented to this
prohibition under the impression that the articles named
were peculiarly the products of the West Indies, not being aware
that cotton was rapidly becoming an important export from
the southern states. The operation of the other commercial
clauses was limited to twelve years. By them the United States
was granted limited privileges of trade with the British East
Indies; some provisions were made for reciprocal freedom of
trade between the United States and the British dominions in
Europe; some articles were specified under the head of &ldquo;contraband
of war&rdquo;; it was agreed that whenever provisions were
seized as contraband they should be paid for, and that in cases of
the capture of a vessel carrying contraband goods such goods
only and not the whole cargo should be seized; it was also
agreed that no vessel should be seized merely because it was bound
for a blockaded port, unless it attempted to enter the port
after receiving notice of the blockade. The treaty was laid before
the Senate on the 8th of June 1795, and, with the exception
of the clause relating to trade with the West Indies, was ratified
on the 24th by a vote of 20 to 10. As yet the public was ignorant
of its contents, and although the Senate had enjoined secrecy
on its members even after the treaty had been ratified, Senator
Mason of Virginia gave out a copy for publication only a few
days later. The Republican party, strongly sympathizing with
France and strongly disliking Great Britain, had been opposed
to Jay&rsquo;s mission, and had denounced Jay as a traitor and
guillotined him in effigy when they heard that he was actually
negotiating. The publication of the treaty only added to their
fury. They filled newspapers with articles denouncing it,
wrote virulent pamphlets against it, and burned Jay in effigy.
The British flag was insulted. Hamilton was stoned at a public
meeting in New York while speaking in defence of the treaty, and
Washington was grossly abused for signing it. In the House
of Representatives the Republicans endeavoured to prevent
the execution of the treaty by refusing the necessary appropriations,
and a vote (29th of April, 1795) on a resolution that it
ought to be carried into effect stood 49 to 49; but on the next
day the opposition was defeated by a vote of 51 to 48. Once
in operation, the treaty grew in favour. Two days before landing
on his return from the English mission, Jay had been elected
governor of New York state; notwithstanding his temporary
unpopularity, he was re-elected in April 1798. With the close
of this second term of office in 1801, he ended his public career.
Although not yet fifty-seven years old, he refused all offers
of office and retiring to his estate near Bedford in Westchester
county, N.Y., spent the rest of his life in rarely interrupted
seclusion. In politics he was throughout inclined toward
Conservatism, and after the rise of parties under the federal
government he stood with Alexander Hamilton and John
Adams as one of the foremost leaders of the Federalist party,
as opposed to the Republicans or Democratic-Republicans.
From 1821 until 1828 he was president of the American Bible
Society. He died on the 17th of May 1829. The purity and
integrity of his life are commemorated in a sentence by Daniel
Webster: &ldquo;When the spotless ermine of the judicial robe
fell on John Jay, it touched nothing less spotless than itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Jay&rsquo;s son, <span class="sc">William Jay</span> (1789-1858), was born in New
York City on the 16th of June 1789, graduated from Yale in
1807, and soon afterwards assumed the management of his
father&rsquo;s large estate in Westchester county, N.Y. He was
actively interested in peace, temperance and anti-slavery movements.
He took a prominent part in 1816 in founding the
American Bible Society; was a judge of Westchester county from
1818 to 1843, when he was removed from office by the party in
power in New York, which hoped, by sacrificing an anti-slavery
judge, to gain additional strength in the southern states;
joined the American anti-slavery society in 1834, and held
several important offices in this organization. In 1840, however,
when it began to advocate measures which he deemed too
radical, he withdrew his membership, but with his pen he continued
his labours on behalf of the slave, urging emancipation
in the district of Columbia and the exclusion of slavery from the
Territories, though deprecating any attempt to interfere with
slavery in the states. He was a member of the American peace
society and was its president for several years. His pamphlet,
<i>War and Peace: the Evils of the First with a Plan for Securing
the Last</i>, advocating international arbitration, was published by
the English Peace Society in 1842, and is said to have contributed
to the promulgation, by the powers signing the Treaty of Paris
in 1856, of a protocol expressing the wish that nations, before
resorting to arms, should have recourse to the good offices of a
friendly power. Among William Jay&rsquo;s other writings, the most
important are <i>The Life of John Jay</i> (2 vols., 1833) and a <i>Review
of the Causes and Consequences of the Mexican War</i> (1849). He
died at Bedford on the 14th of October 1858.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAY, WILLIAM<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (1769-1853), English Nonconformist divine,
was born at Tisbury in Wiltshire on the 6th of May 1769. He
adopted his father&rsquo;s trade of stone-mason, but gave it up in
1785 in order to enter the Rev. Cornelius Winter&rsquo;s school at
Marlborough. During the three years that Jay spent there,
his preaching powers were rapidly developed. Before he was
twenty-one he had preached nearly a thousand times, and in
1788 he had for a while occupied Rowland Hill&rsquo;s pulpit in London.
Wishing to continue his reading he accepted the humble pastorate
of Christian Malford, near Chippenham, where he remained
about two years. After one year at Hope chapel, Clifton, he
was called to the ministry of Argyle Independent chapel in Bath;
and on the 30th of January 1791 he began the work of his life
there, attracting hearers of every religious denomination and
of every rank, and winning for himself a wide reputation as a
brilliant pulpit orator, an earnest religious author, and a friendly
counsellor. Sheridan declared him to be the most manly orator
he had ever heard. A long and honourable connexion of sixty-two
years came to an end in January 1853, and he died on the
27th of December following.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JAY<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (Fr. <i>géai</i>), a well-known and very beautiful European
bird, the <i>Corvus glandarius</i> of Linnaeus, the <i>Garrulus glandarius</i>
of modern ornithologists. To this species are more or less
closely allied numerous birds inhabiting the Palaearctic and
Indian regions, as well as the greater part of America,
but not occurring in the Antilles, in the southern portion
of the Neotropical Region, or in the Ethiopian or Australian.
All these birds are commonly called jays, and form a
group of the crows or <i>Corvidae</i>, which may fairly be considered
a sub-family, <i>Garrulinae</i>. Indeed there are, or have been,
systematists who would elevate the jays to the rank of a family
<i>Garrulidae</i>&mdash;a proceeding which seems unnecessary. Some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
them have an unquestionable resemblance to the pies, if the group
now known by that name can be satisfactorily severed from the
true <i>Corvinae</i>. In structure the jays are not readily differentiated
from the pies; but in habit they are much more arboreal,
delighting in thick coverts, seldom appearing in the open, and
seeking their food on or under trees. They seem also never to
walk or run when on the ground, but always to hop. The body-feathers
are commonly loose and soft; and, gaily coloured as are
most of the species, in few of them has the plumage the metallic
glossiness it generally presents in the pies, while the proverbial
beauty of the &ldquo;jay&rsquo;s wing&rdquo; is due to the vivid tints of blue&mdash;turquoise
and cobalt, heightened by bars of jet-black, an indication
of the same style of ornament being observable in the greater
number of the other forms of the group, and in some predominating
over nearly the whole surface. Of the many genera
that have been proposed by ornithologists, perhaps about nine
may be deemed sufficiently well established.</p>

<p>The ordinary European jay, <i>Garrulus glandarius</i> (fig. 1), has
suffered so much persecution in the British Islands as to have
become in many districts a rare bird. In Ireland it seems now
to be indigenous to the southern half of the island only; in
England generally, it is far less numerous than formerly; and
in Scotland its numbers have decreased with still greater rapidity.
There is little doubt that it would have been exterminated but
for its stock being supplied in autumn by immigration, and for
its shy and wary behaviour, especially at the breeding-season,
when it becomes almost wholly mute, and thereby often escapes
detection. No truthful man, however much he may love the
bird, will gainsay the depredations on fruit and eggs that it at
times commits; but the gardeners and gamekeepers of Britain,
instead of taking a few simple steps to guard their charge from
injury, deliberately adopt methods of wholesale destruction&mdash;methods
that in the case of this species are only too easy and too
effectual&mdash;by proffering temptation to trespass which it is not in
jay-nature to resist, and accordingly the bird runs great chance
of total extirpation. Notwithstanding the war carried on against
the jay, its varied cries and active gesticulations show it to be a
sprightly bird, and at a distance that renders its beauty-spots
invisible, it is yet rendered conspicuous by its cinnamon-coloured
body and pure white tail-coverts, which contrast with the deep
black and rich chestnut that otherwise mark its plumage, and
even the young at once assume a dress closely resembling that
of the adult. The nest, generally concealed in a leafy tree or
bush, is carefully built, with a lining formed of fine roots neatly
interwoven. Herein from four to seven eggs, of a greenish-white
closely freckled, so as to seem suffused with light olive,
are laid in March or April, and the young on quitting it accompany
their parents for some weeks.</p>

<p>Though the common jay of Europe inhabits nearly the whole
of this quarter of the globe south of 64° N. lat., its territory in
the east of Russia is also occupied by <i>G. brandti</i>, a kindred form,
which replaces it on the other side of the Ural, and ranges thence
across Siberia to Japan; and again on the lower Danube and
thence to Constantinople the nearly allied <i>G. krynicki</i> (which
alone is found in southern Russia, Caucasia and Asia Minor)
shares its haunts with it.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It also crosses the Mediterranean
to Algeria and Morocco; but there, as in southern Spain, it is
probably but a winter immigrant. The three forms just named
have the widest range of any of the genus. Next to them come
<i>G. atricapillus</i>, reaching from Syria to Baluchistan, <i>G. japonicus</i>,
the ordinary jay of southern Japan, and <i>G. sinensis</i>, the Chinese
bird. Other forms have a much more limited area, as <i>G. cervicalis</i>,
the local and resident jay of Algeria, <i>G. hyrcanus</i>, found on the
southern shores of the Caspian Sea, and <i>G. taevanus</i>, confined to
the island of Formosa. The most aberrant of the true jays is
<i>G. lidthi</i>, a very rare species, which seems to come from some
part of Japan (<i>vide</i> Salvadori, <i>Atti Accad. Torino</i>, vii. 474),
though its exact locality is not known.</p>

<p>Leaving the true jays of the genus <i>Garrulus</i>, it is expedient
next to consider those of a group named, in 1831, <i>Perisoreus</i>
by Prince C. L. Bonaparte (<i>Saggio</i>, &amp;c., <i>Anim. Vertebrati</i>, p. 43)
and <i>Dysornithia</i> by Swainson (<i>F. B.-Americana</i>, ii. 495).<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>This group contains two species&mdash;one the Lanius infaustus of
Linnaeus and the Siberian jay of English writers, which ranges
throughout the pine-forests of the north of Europe and Asia, and
the second the <i>Corvus canadensis</i> of the same author, or Canada
jay, occupying a similar station in America. The so-called
Siberian jay is one of the most entertaining birds in the world. Its
versatile cries and actions, as seen and heard by those who penetrate
the solitude of the northern forests it inhabits, can never be
forgotten by one who has had experience of them, any more than
the pleasing sight of its rust-coloured tail, which an occasional
gleam of sunshine will light up into a brilliancy quite unexpected
by those who have only surveyed the bird&rsquo;s otherwise gloomy
appearance in
the glass-case of
a museum. It
seems scarcely to
know fear, obtruding
itself on
the notice of any
traveller who invades
its haunts,
and, should he
halt, making itself
at once a
denizen of his
bivouac. In confinement
it
speedily becomes
friendly, but suitable
food for it is
not easily found.
Linnaeus seems
to have been
under a misapprehension
when
he applied to it
the trivial epithet it bears; for by none of his countrymen is it
deemed an unlucky bird, but rather the reverse. In fact, no one
can listen to the cheery sound of its ordinary calls with any but
a hopeful feeling. The Canada jay, or &ldquo;whisky-jack&rdquo; (the
corruption probably of a Cree name), seems to be of a similar
nature, but it presents a still more sombre coloration, its nestling

is one of the most conspicuous birds of the Transatlantic woods.
The account of its habits by Alexander Wilson is known to every
student of ornithology, and Wilson&rsquo;s followers have had little to
do but supplement his history with unimportant details. In
this bird and its many allied forms, coloration, though almost
confined to various tints of blue, seems to reach its climax, but
want of space forbids more particular notice of them, or of the
members of the other genera <i>Cyanocitta</i>, <i>Cyanocorax</i>, <i>Xanthura</i>,
<i>Psilorhinus</i>, and more, which inhabit various parts of the
Western continent. It remains, however, to mention the genus
Cissa, including many beautiful forms belonging to the Indian
region, and among them the <i>C. speciosa</i> and <i>C. sinensis</i>, so often
represented in Oriental drawings, though doubts may be expressed
whether these birds are not more nearly related to the
pies than to the jays.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEALOUSY<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (adapted from Fr. <i>jalousie</i>, formed from <i>jaloux</i>,
jealous, Low Lat. <i>zelosus</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="zêlos">&#950;&#8134;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, ardour, zeal, from the root
seen in <span class="grk" title="zéein">&#950;&#941;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to boil, ferment; cf. &ldquo;yeast&rdquo;), originally a condition
of zealous emulation, and hence, in the usual modern sense,
of resentment at being (or believing that one is or may be)
supplanted or preferred in the love or affection of another, or in
the enjoyment of some good regarded as properly one&rsquo;s own.
Jealousy is really a form of envy, but implies a feeling of personal
claim which in envy or covetousness is wanting. The jealousy
of God, as in Exod. xx. 5, &ldquo;For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous
God,&rdquo; has been defined by Pusey (<i>Minor Prophets</i>, 1860) as the
attribute &ldquo;whereby he does not endure the love of his creatures
to be transferred from him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Jealous,&rdquo; by etymology, is
however, only another form of &ldquo;zealous,&rdquo; and the identity is
exemplified by such expressions as &ldquo;I have been very jealous
for the Lord God of Hosts&rdquo; (1 Kings xix. 10). A kind of glass,
thick, ribbed and non-transparent, was formerly known as
&ldquo;jealous-glass,&rdquo; and this application is seen in the borrowed
French word <i>jalousie</i>, a blind or shutter, made of slats of wood,
which slope in such a way as to admit air and a certain amount
of light, while excluding rain and sun and inspection from
without.</p>

Antoine du Val and Fouquart de Cambrai in the authorship of
a collection of stories entitled <i>Évangiles de quenouille</i>. They
purport to record the narratives of a group of ladies at their

<p><span class="bold">JEAN DE MEUN,<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> or <span class="sc">De Meung</span> (<i>c.</i> 1250-<i>c.</i> 1305), whose
original name was Jean Clopinel or Chopinel, was born at Meun-sur-Loire.
Tradition asserts that he studied at the university
of Paris. At any rate he was, like his contemporary, Rutebeuf,
a defender of Guillaume de Saint-Amour and a bitter critic of the
mendicant orders. Most of his life seems to have been spent in
Paris, where he possessed, in the Rue Saint-Jacques, a house with
a tower, court and garden, which was described in 1305 as the
house of the late Jean de Meung, and was then bestowed by a
certain Adam d&rsquo;Andely on the Dominicans. Jean de Meun says
that in his youth he composed songs that were sung in every
public place and school in France. In the enumeration of his
own works he places first his continuation of the <i>Roman de la
rose</i> of Guillaume de Lorris (<i>q.v.</i>). The date of this second part
is generally fixed between 1268 and 1285 by a reference in the
poem to the death of Manfred and Conradin, executed (1268) by
order of Charles of Anjou (d. 1285) who is described as the present
king of Sicily. M. F. Guillon (<i>Jean Clopinel</i>, 1903), however,
considering the poem primarily as a political satire, places it in
the last five years of the 13th century. Jean de Meun doubtless
edited the work of his predecessor, Guillaume de Lorris, before
using it as the starting-point of his own vast poem, running to
19,000 lines. The continuation of Jean de Meun is a satire on
the monastic orders, on celibacy, on the nobility, the papal see,
the excessive pretensions of royalty, and especially on women
and marriage. Guillaume had been the servant of love, and the
exponent of the laws of &ldquo;courtoisie&rdquo;; Jean de Meun added an
&ldquo;art of love,&rdquo; exposing with brutality the vices of women, their
arts of deception, and the means by which men may outwit
them. Jean de Meun embodied the mocking, sceptical spirit of
the <i>fabliaux</i>. He did not share in current superstitions, he had
no respect for established institutions, and he scorned the conventions
of feudalism and romance. His poem shows in the
highest degree, in spite of the looseness of its plan, the faculty of
keen observation, of lucid reasoning and exposition, and it entitles
him to be considered the greatest of French medieval poets.
He handled the French language with an ease and precision
unknown to his predecessors, and the length of his poem was no
bar to its popularity in the 13th and 14th centuries. Part of its
vogue was no doubt due to the fact that the author, who had
mastered practically all the scientific and literary knowledge of
his contemporaries in France, had found room in his poem for a
great amount of useful information and for numerous citations
from classical authors. The book was attacked by Guillaume de
Degulleville in his <i>Pèlerinage de la vie humaine</i> (<i>c.</i> 1330), long a
favourite work both in England and France; by John Gerson,
and by Christine de Pisan in her <i>Épître au dieu d&rsquo;amour</i>; but it
also found energetic defenders.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Jean de Meun translated in 1284 the treatise, <i>De re militari</i>, of
Vegetius into French as <i>Le livre de Vegèce de l&rsquo;art de chevalerie</i><a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (ed.
Ulysse Robert, <i>Soc. des anciens textes fr.</i>, 1897). He also produced
a spirited version, the first in French, of the letters of Abelard and
Hèloïse. A 14th-century MS. of this translation in the Bibliothèque
Nationale has annotations by Petrarch. His translation of the
<i>De consolatione philosophiae</i> of Boëtius is preceded by a letter to
Philip IV. in which he enumerates his earlier works, two of which
are lost&mdash;<i>De spirituelle amitié</i> from the <i>De spirituali amicitia</i> of
Aelred of Rievaulx (d. 1166), and the <i>Livre des merveilles d&rsquo;Hirlande</i>
from the <i>Topographia Hibernica</i>, or <i>De Mirabilibus Hiberniae</i> of
Giraldus Cambrensis (Giraud de Barry). His last poems are
doubtless his <i>Testament</i> and <i>Codicille</i>. The <i>Testament</i> is written in
quatrains in monorime, and contains advice to the different classes
of the community.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEBEIL<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (anc. <i>Gebal-Byblus</i>), a town of Syria pleasantly
situated on a slight eminence near the sea, about 20 m. N. of
Beirut. It is surrounded by a wall 1½ m. in circumference, with
square towers at the angles, and a castle at the south-east corner.
Numerous broken granite columns in the gardens and vineyards
that surround the town, with the number of ruined houses within
the walls, testify to its former importance. The stele of Jehawmelek,
king of Gebal, found here, is one of the most important
of Phoenician monuments. The small port is almost choked up
with sand and ruins. Pop. 3000, all Moslems.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Phoenician Gebal and Greek Byblus
were renowned as stonecutters and ship-builders. Arrian (ii. 20. 1)
represents Enylus, king of Byblus, as joining Alexander with a
fleet, after that monarch had captured the city. Philo of Byblus
makes it the most ancient city of Phoenicia, founded by Cronus,
<i>i.e.</i> the Moloch who appears from the stele of Jehawmelek to have
been with Baalit the chief deity of the city. According to
Plutarch (<i>Mor.</i> 357), the ark with the corpse of Osiris was cast
ashore at Byblus, and there found by Isis. The orgies of Adonis
in the temple of Baalit (Aphrodite Byblia) are described by
Lucian, <i>De Dea Syr.</i>, cap. vi. The river Adonis is the Nahr al-Ibrahim,
which flows near the town. The crusaders, after failing
before it in 1099, captured &ldquo;Giblet&rdquo; in 1103, but lost it again
to Saladin in 1189. Under Mahommedan rule it has gradually (D. G. H.)
decayed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEDBURGH,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> a royal and police burgh and county-town of
Roxburghshire, Scotland. Pop. of police burgh (1901), 3136.
It is situated on Jed Water, a tributary of the Teviot, 56¼ m. S.E.
of Edinburgh by the North British railway, via Roxburgh and
St Boswells (49 m. by road), and 10 m. from the border at
Catcleuch Shin, a peak of the Cheviots, 1742 ft. high. Of the
name Jedburgh there have been many variants, the earliest being
Gedwearde (800), Jedwarth (1251), and Geddart (1586), while
locally the word is sometimes pronounced Jethart. The town
is situated on the left bank of the Jed, the main streets running
at right angles from each side of the central market-place. Of
the renowned group of Border abbeys&mdash;Jedburgh, Melrose,
Dryburgh and Kelso&mdash;that of Jedburgh is the stateliest. In
1118, according to tradition, but more probably as late as 1138,
David, prince of Cumbria, here founded a priory for Augustinian
monks from the abbey of St Quentin at Beauvais in France, and
in 1147, after he had become king, erected it into an abbey
dedicated to the Virgin. Repeatedly damaged in Border warfare,
it was ruined in 1544-45 during the English invasion led by
Sir Ralph Evers (or Eure). The establishment was suppressed
in 1559, the revenues being temporarily annexed to the Crown.
After changing owners more than once, the lands were purchased
in 1637 by the 3rd earl of Lothian. Latterly five of the bays at
the west end had been utilized as the parish church, but in 1873-1875
the 9th marquess of Lothian built a church for the service
of the parish, and presented it to the heritors in exchange for the
ruined abbey in order to prevent the latter from being injured
by modern additions and alterations.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The abbey was built of Old Red sandstone, and belongs mostly
to the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th centuries. The
architecture is mixed, and the abbey is a beautiful example of the
Norman and Transition styles. The total length is 235 ft., the nave
being 133½ ft. long and 59½ ft. wide. The west front contains a
great Norman porch and a fine wheel window. The nave, on each
side, has nine pointed arches in the basement storey, nine round
arches in the triforium, and thirty-six pointed arches in the clerestory,
through which an arcade is carried on both sides. The tower,
at the intersection of the nave and transepts, is of unusually massive
proportions, being 30 ft. square and fully 100 ft. high; the network
baluster round the top is modern. With the exception of the north
piers and a small portion of the wall above, which are Norman, the
tower dates from the end of the 15th century. The whole of the
south transept has perished. The north transept, with early
Decorated windows, has been covered in and walled off, and is the
burial-ground of the Kerrs of Fernihirst, ancestors of the marquess
of Lothian. The earliest tombstone is dated 1524; one of the
latest is the recumbent effigy, by G. F. Watts, R.A., of the 8th
marquess of Lothian (1832-1870). All that is left of the choir,
which contains some very early Norman work, is two bays with three
tiers on each side, corresponding to the design of the nave. It is
supposed that the aisle, with Decorated window and groined roof,
south of the chancel, formed the grammar school (removed from the
abbey in 1751) in which Samuel Rutherford (1600-1661), principal
of St Mary&rsquo;s College, St Andrews, and James Thomson, author of
The <i>Seasons</i>, were educated. The door leading from the south aisle
into a herbaceous garden, formerly the cloister, is an exquisite copy
of one which had become greatly decayed. It was designed by Sir
Rowand Anderson, under whose superintendence restoration in the
abbey was carried out.</p>
</div>

<p>The castle stood on high ground at the south end of the burgh,
or &ldquo;town-head.&rdquo; Erected by David I., it was one of the strongholds
ceded to England in 1174, under the treaty of Falaise, for
the ransom of William the Lion. It was, however, so often
captured by the English that it became a menace rather than a
protection, and the townsfolk demolished it in 1409. It had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
occasionally been used as a royal residence, and was the scene, in
November 1285, of the revels held in celebration of the marriage
(solemnized in the abbey) of Alexander III. to Joleta, or Yolande,
daughter of the count of Dreux. The site was occupied in 1823
by the county prison, now known as the castle, a castellated
structure which gradually fell into disuse and was acquired by
the corporation in 1890. A house exists in Backgate in which
Mary Queen of Scots resided in 1566, and one in Castlegate
which Prince Charles Edward occupied in 1745.</p>

<p>The public buildings include the grammar school (built in
1883 to replace the successor of the school in the abbey), founded
by William Turnbull, bishop of Glasgow (d. 1454), the county
buildings, the free library and the public hall, which succeeded to
the corn exchange destroyed by fire in 1898, a loss that involved
the museum and its contents, including the banners captured
by the Jethart weavers at Bannockburn and Killiecrankie. The
old market cross still exists, and there are two public parks.
The chief industry is the manufacture of woollens (blankets,
hosiery), but brewing, tanning and iron-founding are carried on,
and fruit (especially pears) and garden produce are in repute.
Jedburgh was made a royal burgh in the reign of David I., and
received a charter from Robert I. and another, in 1566, from
Mary Queen of Scots. Sacked and burned time after time during
the Border strife, it was inevitable that the townsmen should
become keen fighters. Their cry of &ldquo;Jethart&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; was heard
wherever the fray waxed most fiercely, and the Jethart axe of
their invention&mdash;a steel axe on a 4-ft. pole&mdash;wrought havoc in
their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jethart or Jeddart justice,&rdquo; according to which a man was
hanged first and tried afterwards, seems to have been a hasty
generalization from a solitary fact&mdash;the summary execution in
James VI.&rsquo;s reign of a gang of rogues at the instance of Sir
George Home, but has nevertheless passed into a proverb.</p>

<p>Old Jeddart, 4 m. S. of the present town, the first site of the
burgh, is now marked by a few grassy mounds, and of the great
Jedburgh forest, only the venerable oaks, the &ldquo;Capon Tree&rdquo; and

<p><span class="bold">JEEJEEBHOY<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Jijibhai</span>), <span class="bold">SIR JAMSETJEE</span> (<span class="sc">Jamsetji</span>),
Bart. (1783-1859), Indian merchant and philanthropist, was
born in Bombay in 1783, of poor but respectable parents, and
was left an orphan in early life. At the age of sixteen, with a
smattering of mercantile education and a bare pittance, he
commenced a series of business travels destined to lead him to
fortune and fame. After a preliminary visit to Calcutta, he undertook
a voyage to China, then fraught with so much difficulty and
risk that it was regarded as a venture betokening considerable
enterprise and courage; and he subsequently initiated a systematic
trade with that country, being himself the carrier of his
merchant wares on his passages to and fro between Bombay and
Canton and Shanghai. His second return voyage from China
was made in one of the East India Company&rsquo;s fleet, which, under
the command of Sir Nathaniel Dance, defeated the French
squadron under Admiral Linois (Feb. 15, 1804). On his
fourth return voyage from China, the Indiaman in which he
sailed was forced to surrender to the French, by whom he was
carried as a prisoner to the Cape of Good Hope, then a neutral
Dutch possession; and it was only after much delay, and with
great difficulty, that he made his way to Calcutta in a Danish
ship. Nothing daunted, he undertook yet another voyage to
China, which was more successful than any of the previous ones.
By this time he had fairly established his reputation as a merchant
possessed of the highest spirit of enterprise and considerable
wealth, and thenceforward he settled down in Bombay,
where he directed his commercial operations on a widely extended
scale. By 1836 his firm was large enough to engross the energies
of his three sons and other relatives; and he had amassed what
at that period of Indian mercantile history was regarded as
fabulous wealth. An essentially self-made man, having experienced
in early life the miseries of poverty and want, in his days
of affluence Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy developed an active instinct
of sympathy with his poorer countrymen, and commenced that
career of private and public philanthropy which is his chief title
to the admiration of mankind. His liberality was unbounded,
and the absorbing occupation of his later life was the alleviation
of human distress. To his own community he gave lavishly,
but his benevolence was mainly cosmopolitan. Hospitals,
schools, homes of charity, pension funds, were founded or endowed
by him, while numerous public works in the shape of wells,
reservoirs, bridges, causeways, and the like, not only in Bombay,
but in other parts of India, were the creation of his bounty. The
total of his known benefactions amounted at the time of his
death, which took place in 1859, to over £230,000. It was not,
however, the amount of his charities so much as the period and
circumstances in which they were performed that made his
benevolent career worthy of the fame he won. In the first half
of the 19th century the various communities of India were much
more isolated in their habits and their sympathies than they are
now. Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy&rsquo;s unsectarian philanthropy awakened
a common understanding and created a bond between them
which has proved not only of domestic value but has had a
national and political significance. His services were recognized
first in 1842 by the bestowal of a knighthood upon him, and in
1858 by that of a baronetcy. These were the very first distinctions
of their kind conferred by Queen Victoria upon a British
subject in India.</p>

<p>His title devolved in 1859 on his eldest son <span class="sc">Cursetjee</span>, who,
by a special Act of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Council in pursuance of a
provision in the letters-patent, took the name of Sir Jamsetjee
Jeejeebhoy as second baronet. At his death in 1877 his eldest
son, <span class="sc">Menekjee</span>, became Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, the third
baronet. Both had the advantage of a good English education,
and continued the career of benevolent activity and devoted
loyalty to British rule which had signalized the life-work of the
founder of the family. They both visited England to do homage
to their sovereign; and their public services were recognized
by their nomination to the order of the Star of India, as well
as by appointment to the Legislative Councils of Calcutta and
Bombay.</p>

<p>On the death of the third baronet, the title devolved upon his
brother, <span class="sc">Cowsajee</span> (1853-1908), who became Sir Jamsetjee
Jeejeebhoy, fourth baronet, and the recognized leader of the
Parsee community all over the world. He was succeeded by
his son <span class="sc">Rustomjee</span> (b. 1878), who became Sir Jamsetjee
Jeejeebhoy, fifth baronet.</p>

<p>Since their emigration from Persia, the Parsee community had
never had a titular chief or head, its communal funds and affairs
being managed by a public body, more or less democratic in its
constitution, termed the Parsee panchayat. The first Sir
Jamsetjee, by the hold that he established on the community,
by his charities and public spirit, gradually came to be regarded
in the light of its chief; and the recognition which he was the
first in India to receive at the hands of the British sovereign
finally fixed him and his successors in the baronetcy in the position
and title of the official Parsee leader.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEFFERIES, RICHARD<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (1848-1887), English naturalist and
author, was born on the 6th of November 1848, at the farmhouse
of Coate about 2½ m. from Swindon, on the road to Marlborough.
He was sent to school, first at Sydenham and then at Swindon,
till the age of fifteen or so, but his actual education was at the
hands of his father, who gave him his love for Nature and taught
him how to observe. For the faculty of observation, as Jefferies,
Gilbert White, and H. D. Thoreau have remarked, several gifts are
necessary, including the possession of long sight and quick sight,
two things which do not always go together. To them must be
joined trained sight and the knowledge of what to expect. The
boy&rsquo;s father first showed him what there was to look for in the
hedge, in the field, in the trees, and in the sky. This kind of
training would in many cases be wasted: to one who can understand
it, the book of Nature will by-and-by offer pages which are
blurred and illegible to the city-bred lad, and even to the country
lad the power of reading them must be maintained by constant
practice. To live amid streets or in the working world destroys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
it. The observer must live alone and always in the country;
he must not worry himself about the ways of the world; he must
be always, from day to day, watching the infinite changes and
variations of Nature. Perhaps, even when the observer can
actually read this book of Nature, his power of articulate speech
may prove inadequate for the expression of what he sees. But
Jefferies, as a boy, was more than an observer of the fields; he
was bookish, and read all the books that he could borrow or buy.
And presently, as is apt to be the fate of a bookish boy who cannot
enter a learned profession, he became a journalist and obtained
a post on the local paper. He developed literary ambitions, but
for a long time to come was as one beating the air. He tried local
history and novels; but his early novels, which were published
at his own risk and expense, were, deservedly, failures. In 1872,
however, he published a remarkable letter in <i>The Times</i>, on
&ldquo;The Wiltshire Labourer,&rdquo; full of original ideas and of facts
new to most readers. This was in reality the turning-point
in his career. In 1873, after more false starts, Jefferies
returned to his true field of work, the life of the country,
and began to write for <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i> on &ldquo;Farming and
Farmers.&rdquo; He had now found himself. The rest of his
history is that of continual advance, from close observation
becoming daily more and more close, to that intimate communion
with Nature with which his later pages are filled. The
developments of the later period are throughout touched
with the melancholy that belongs to ill-health. For, though in
his prose poem called &ldquo;The Pageant of Summer&rdquo; the writer
seems absolutely revelling in the strength of manhood that belongs
to that pageant, yet, in the <i>Story of My Heart</i>, written about
the same time, we detect the mind that is continually turned to
death. He died at Goring, worn out with many ailments, on the
14th of August 1887. The best-known books of Richard Jefferies
are: <i>The Gamekeeper at Home</i> (1878); <i>The Story of My Heart</i>
(1883); <i>Life of the Fields</i> (1884), containing the best paper he ever
wrote, &ldquo;The Pageant of Summer&rdquo;; <i>Amaryllis at the Fair</i> (1884),
in which may be found the portraits of his own people; and <i>The
Open Air</i>. He stands among the scanty company of men who
address a small audience, for whom he read aloud these pages of
Nature spoken of above, which only he, and the few like unto
him, can decipher.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEFFERSON, JOSEPH<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1820-1905), American actor, was born
in Philadelphia on the 20th of February 1829. He was the third
actor of this name in a family of actors and managers, and the
most famous of all American comedians. At the age of three he
appeared as the boy in Kotzebue&rsquo;s <i>Pizarro</i>, and throughout his
youth he underwent all the hardships connected with theatrical
touring in those early days. After a miscellaneous experience,
partly as actor, partly as manager, he won his first pronounced
success in 1858 as Asa Trenchard in Tom Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Our American
Cousin</i> at Laura Keene&rsquo;s theatre in New York. This play was
the turning-point of his career, as it was of Sothern&rsquo;s. The
naturalness and spontaneity of humour with which he acted the
love scenes revealed a spirit in comedy new to his contemporaries,
long used to a more artificial convention; and the touch of pathos
which the part required revealed no less to the actor an unexpected
power in himself. Other early parts were Newman Noggs
in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, Caleb Plummer in <i>The Cricket on the Hearth</i>,
Dr Pangloss in <i>The Heir at Law</i>, Salem Scudder in <i>The Octoroon</i>,
and Bob Acres in <i>The Rivals</i>, the last being not so much an interpretation
of the character as Sheridan sketched it as a creation
of the actor&rsquo;s. In 1859 Jefferson made a dramatic version of the
story of <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> on the basis of older plays, and acted
it with success at Washington. The play was given its permanent
form by Dion Boucicault in London, where (1865) it ran 170
nights, with Jefferson in the leading part. Jefferson continued
to act with undiminished popularity in a limited number of parts
in nearly every town in the United States, his Rip Van Winkle,
Bob Acres, and Caleb Plummer being the most popular. He was
one of the first to establish the travelling combinations which
superseded the old system of local stock companies. With the
exception of minor parts, such as the First Gravedigger in
<i>Hamlet</i>, which he played in an &ldquo;all star combination&rdquo; headed
by Edwin Booth, Jefferson created no new character after 1865;
and the success of Rip Van Winkle was so pronounced that he
has often been called a one-part actor. If this was a fault, it was
the public&rsquo;s, who never wearied of his one masterpiece. Jefferson
died on the 23rd of April 1905. No man in his profession was
more honoured for his achievements or his character. He was
the friend of many of the leading men in American politics, art
and literature. He was an ardent fisherman and lover of nature,
and devoted to painting. Jefferson was twice married: to an
actress, Margaret Clements Lockyer (1832-1861), in 1850, and in
1867 to Sarah Warren, niece of William Warren the actor.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s <i>Autobiography</i> (New York, 1889) is written with admirable
spirit and humour, and its judgments with regard to the art
of the actor and of the playwright entitle it to a place beside Cibber&rsquo;s
<i>Apology</i>. See William Winter, <i>The Jeffersons</i> (1881), and <i>Life of
Joseph Jefferson</i> (1894); Mrs. E. P. Jefferson, <i>Recollections of Joseph

<p><span class="bold">JEFFERSON, THOMAS<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (1743-1826), third president of the
United States of America, and the most conspicuous apostle of
democracy in America, was born on the 13th of April 1743,
at Shadwell, Albemarle county, Virginia. His father, Peter
Jefferson (1707-1757), of early Virginian yeoman stock, was a
civil engineer and a man of remarkable energy, who became a
justice of the peace, a county surveyor and a burgess, served the
Crown in inter-colonial boundary surveys, and married into one
of the most prominent colonial families, the Randolphs. Albemarle
county was then in the frontier wilderness of the Blue
Ridge, and was very different, socially, from the lowland counties
where a few broad-acred families dominated an open-handed,
somewhat luxurious and assertive aristocracy. Unlike his
Randolph connexions, Peter Jefferson was a whig and a thorough
democrat; from him, and probably, too, from the Albemarle
environment, his son came naturally by democratic inclinations.</p>

<p>Jefferson carried with him from the college of William and
Mary at Williamsburg, in his twentieth year, a good knowledge
of Latin, Greek and French (to which he soon added Spanish,
Italian and Anglo-Saxon), and a familiarity with the higher
mathematics and natural sciences only possessed, at his age, by
men who have a rare natural taste and ability for those studies.
He remained an ardent student throughout life, able to give and
take in association with the many scholars, American and foreign,
whom he numbered among his friends and correspondents.
With a liberal Scotsman, Dr William Small, then of the faculty
of William and Mary and later a friend of Erasmus Darwin, and
George Wythe (1726-1806), a very accomplished scholar and
leader of the Virginia bar, Jefferson was an habitual member,
while still in college, of a <i>partie carrée</i> at the table of Francis
Fauquier (<i>c.</i> 1720-1768), the accomplished lieutenant-governor
of Virginia. Jefferson was an expert violinist, a good singer and
dancer, proficient in outdoor sports, and an excellent horseman.
Thorough-bred horses always remained to him a necessary
luxury. When it is added that Fauquier was a passionate
gambler, and that the gentry who gathered every winter at
Williamsburg, the seat of government of the province, were
ruinously addicted to the same weakness, and that Jefferson had
a taste for racing, it does credit to his early strength of character
that of his social opportunities he took only the better. He
never used tobacco, never played cards, never gambled, and was
never party to a personal quarrel.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving college he entered Wythe&rsquo;s law office, and
in 1767, after five years of close study, was admitted to the bar.
His thorough preparation enabled him to compete from the first
with the leading lawyers of the colony, and his success shows that
the bar had no rewards that were not fairly within his reach. As
an advocate, however, he did not shine; a weakness of voice made
continued speaking impossible, and he had neither the ability
nor the temperament for oratory. To his legal scholarship and
collecting zeal Virginia owed the preservation of a large part
of her early statutes. He seems to have lacked interest in
litigiousness, which was extraordinarily developed in colonial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
Virginia; and he saw and wished to reform the law&rsquo;s abuses.
It is probable that he turned, therefore, the more willingly to
politics; at any rate, soon after entering public life he abandoned
practice (1774).</p>

<p>The death of his father had left him an estate of 1900 acres, the
income from which (about £400) gave him the position of an
independent country gentleman; and while engaged in the law
he had added to his farms after the ambitious Virginia fashion,
until, when he married in his thirtieth year, there were 5000
acres all paid for; and almost as much more<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> came to him in 1773
on the death of his father-in-law. On the 1st of January 1772,
Jefferson married Martha Wayles Skelton (1749-1782), a childless
widow of twenty-three, very handsome, accomplished, and very
fond of music. Their married life was exceedingly happy, and
Jefferson never remarried after her early death. Of six children
born from their union, two daughters alone survived infancy.
Jefferson was emotional and very affectionate in his home, and
his generous and devoted relations with his children and grandchildren
are among the finest features of his character.</p>

<p>Jefferson began his public service as a justice of the peace and
parish vestryman; he was chosen a member of the Virginia house
of burgesses in 1769 and of every succeeding assembly and convention
of the colony until he entered the Continental Congress
in 1775. His forceful, facile pen gave him great influence from
the first; but though a foremost member of several great deliberative
bodies, he can fairly be said never to have made a speech.
He hated the &ldquo;morbid rage of debate&rdquo; because he believed that
men were never convinced by argument, but only by reflection,
through reading or unprovocative conversation; and this belief
guided him through life. Moreover it is very improbable that
he could ever have shone as a public speaker, and to this fact
unfriendly critics have attributed, at least in part, his abstention
from debate. The house of burgesses of 1769, and its successors
in 1773 and 1774, were dissolved by the governor (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Virginia</a></span>)
for their action on the subject of colonial grievances and inter-colonial
co-operation. Jefferson was prominent in all; was a
signer of the Virginia agreement of non-importation and economy
(1769); and was elected in 1774 to the first Virginia convention,
called to consider the state of the colony and advance inter-colonial
union. Prevented by illness from attending, Jefferson
sent to the convention elaborate resolutions, which he proposed
as instructions to the Virginia delegates to the Continental
Congress that was to meet at Philadelphia in September. In
the direct language of reproach and advice, with no disingenuous
loading of the Crown&rsquo;s policy upon its agents, these resolutions
attacked the errors of the king, and maintained that &ldquo;the relation
between Great Britain and these colonies was exactly the same
as that of England and Scotland after the accession of James and
until the Union; and that our emigration to this country gave
England no more rights over us than the emigration of the Danes
and Saxons gave to the present authorities of their mother
country over England.&rdquo; This was cutting at the common root
of allegiance, emigration and colonization; but such radicalism
was too thorough-going for the immediate end. The resolutions
were published, however, as a pamphlet, entitled <i>A Summary
View of the Rights of America</i>, which was widely circulated. In
England, after receiving such modifications&mdash;attributed to
Burke&mdash;as adapted it to the purposes of the opposition, this
pamphlet ran through many editions, and procured for its author,
as he said, &ldquo;the honour of having his name inserted in a long
list of proscriptions enrolled in a bill of attainder commenced in
one of the two houses of parliament, but suppressed in embryo
by the hasty course of events.&rdquo; It placed Jefferson among the
foremost leaders of revolution, and procured for him the honour
of drafting, later, the Declaration of Independence, whose
historical portions were, in large part, only a revised transcript
of the <i>Summary View</i>. In June 1775 he took his seat in the
Continental Congress, taking with him fresh credentials of
radicalism in the shape of Virginia&rsquo;s answer, which he had
drafted, to Lord North&rsquo;s conciliatory propositions. Jefferson
soon drafted the reply of Congress to the same propositions.
Reappointed to the next Congress, he signalized his service by
the authorship of the Declaration of Independence (<i>q.v.</i>). Again
reappointed, he surrendered his seat, and after refusing a
proffered election to serve as a commissioner with Benjamin
Franklin and Silas Deane in France, he entered again, in October
1776, the Virginia legislature, where he considered his services
most needed.</p>

<p>The local work to which Jefferson attributed such importance
was a revision of Virginia&rsquo;s laws. Of the measures proposed to
this end he says: &ldquo;I considered four, passed or reported, as
forming a system by which every trace would be eradicated
of ancient or future aristocracy, and a foundation laid for
a government truly republican&rdquo;&mdash;the repeal of the laws of
entail; the abolition of primogeniture and the unequal
division of inheritances (Jefferson was himself an eldest son);
the guarantee of freedom of conscience and relief of the people
from supporting, by taxation, an established church; and a
system of general education. The first object was embodied in
law in 1776, the second in 1785, the third<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> in 1786 (supplemented
1799, 1801). The last two were parts of a body of codified laws
prepared (1776-1779) by Edmund Pendleton,<a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a> George Wythe,
and Jefferson, and principally by Jefferson. Not so fortunate were
Jefferson&rsquo;s ambitious schemes of education. District, grammar
and classical schools, a free state library and a state college, were
all included in his plan. He was the first American statesman
to make education by the state a fundamental article of democratic
faith. His bill for elementary education he regarded as
the most important part of the code, but Virginia had no strong
middle class, and the planters would not assume the burden of
educating the poor. At this time Jefferson championed the
natural right of expatriation, and gradual emancipation of the
slaves. His earliest legislative effort, in the five-day session
of 1769, had been marked by an effort to secure to masters
freedom to manumit their slaves without removing them from
the state. It was unsuccessful, and the more radical measure
he now favoured was even more impossible of attainment; but
a bill he introduced to prohibit the importation of slaves was
passed in 1778&mdash;the only important change effected in the slave
system of the state during the War of Independence. Finally
he endeavoured, though unsuccessfully, to secure the introduction
of juries into the courts of chancery, and&mdash;a generation and
more before the fruition of the labours of Romilly and his co-workers
in England&mdash;aided in securing a humanitarian revision
of the penal code,<a name="fa4h" id="fa4h" href="#ft4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> which, though lost by one vote in 1785, was
sustained by public sentiment, and was adopted in 1796. Jefferson
is of course not entitled to the sole credit for all these
services: Wythe, George Mason and James Madison, in particular,
were his devoted lieutenants, and&mdash;after his departure
for France&mdash;the principals in the struggle; moreover, an approving
public opinion must receive large credit. But Jefferson was
throughout the chief inspirer and foremost worker.</p>

<p>In 1779, at almost the gloomiest stage of the war in the southern
states, Jefferson succeeded Patrick Henry as the governor of
Virginia, being the second to hold that office after the organization
of the state government. In his second term (1780-1781)
the state was overrun by British expeditions, and Jefferson, a
civilian, was blamed for the ineffectual resistance. Though he
cannot be said to have been eminently fitted for the task that
devolved upon him in such a crisis, most of the criticism of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
administration was undoubtedly grossly unjust. His conduct
being attacked, he declined renomination for the governorship,
but was unanimously returned by Albemarle as a delegate to the
state legislature; and on the day previously set for legislative
inquiry on a resolution offered by an impulsive critic, he received,
by unanimous vote of the house, a declaration of thanks and
confidence. He wished however to retire permanently from
public life, a wish strengthened by the illness and death of his
wife. At this time he composed his <i>Notes on Virginia</i>, a semi-statistical
work full of humanitarian liberalism. Congress twice
offered him an appointment as one of the plenipotentiaries to
negotiate peace with England, but, though he accepted the
second offer, the business was so far advanced before he could
sail that his appointment was recalled. During the following
winter (1783) he was again in Congress, and headed the committee
appointed to consider the treaty of peace. In the succeeding
session his service was marked by a report, from which resulted
the present monetary system of the United States (the fundamental
idea of its decimal basis being due, however, to Gouverneur
Morris); and by the honour of reporting the first definitely
formulated plan for the government of the western territories,<a name="fa5h" id="fa5h" href="#ft5h"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
that embodied in the ordinance of 1784. He was already
particularly associated with the great territory north-west of the
Ohio; for Virginia had tendered to Congress in 1781, while
Jefferson was governor, a cession of her claims to it, and now in
1784 formally transferred the territory by act of Jefferson and
his fellow delegates in congress: a consummation for which he
had laboured from the beginning. His anti-slavery opinions
grew in strength with years (though he was somewhat inconsistent
in his attitude on the Missouri question in 1820-1821). Not
only justice but patriotism as well pleaded with him the cause of
the negroes,<a name="fa6h" id="fa6h" href="#ft6h"><span class="sp">6</span></a> for he foresaw the certainty that the race must some
day, in some way, be freed, and the dire political dangers involved
in the institution of slavery; and could any feasible plan of
emancipation have been suggested he would have regarded its
cost as a mere bagatelle.</p>

<p>From 1784 to 1789 Jefferson was in France, first under an
appointment to assist Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in
negotiating treaties of commerce with European states, and then
as Franklin&rsquo;s successor (1785-1789) as minister to France.<a name="fa7h" id="fa7h" href="#ft7h"><span class="sp">7</span></a> In
these years he travelled widely in western Europe. Though the
commercial principles of the United States were far too liberal
for acceptance, as such, by powers holding colonies in America,
Jefferson won some specific concessions to American trade. He
was exceedingly popular as a minister. The criticism is even
to-day current with the uninformed that Jefferson took his
manners,<a name="fa8h" id="fa8h" href="#ft8h"><span class="sp">8</span></a> morals, &ldquo;irreligion&rdquo; and political philosophy from his
French residence; and it cannot be wholly ignored. It may
therefore be said that there is nothing except unsubstantiated
scandal to contradict the conclusion, which various evidence
supports, that Jefferson&rsquo;s morals were pure. His religious views
and political beliefs will be discussed later. His theories had a
deep and broad basis in English whiggism; and though he may
well have found at least confirmation of his own ideas in French
writers&mdash;and notably in Condorcet&mdash;he did not read sympathetically
the writers commonly named, Rousseau and Montesquieu;
besides, his democracy was seasoned, and he was rather
a teacher than a student of revolutionary politics when he went
to Paris. The <i>Notes on Virginia</i> were widely read in Paris, and
undoubtedly had some influence in forwarding the dissolution
of the doctrines of divine rights and passive obedience among
the cultivated classes of France. Jefferson was deeply interested
in all the events leading up to the French Revolution, and all his
ideas were coloured by his experience of the five seething years
passed in Paris. On the 3rd of June 1789 he proposed to the
leaders of the third estate a compromise between the king and
the nation. In July he received the extraordinary honour of
being invited to assist in the deliberations of the committee
appointed by the national assembly to draft a constitution.
This honour his official position compelled him, of course, to
decline; for he sedulously observed official proprieties, and
in no way gave offence to the government to which he was
accredited.</p>

<p>When Jefferson left France it was with the intention of soon
returning; but President Washington tendered him the secretaryship
of state in the new federal government, and Jefferson
reluctantly accepted. His only essential objection to the constitution&mdash;the
absence of a bill of rights&mdash;was soon met, at least
partially, by amendments. Alexander Hamilton (<i>q.v.</i>) was
secretary of the treasury. These two men, antipodal in temperament
and political belief, clashed in irreconcilable hostility, and
in the conflict of public sentiment, first on the financial measures
of Hamilton, and then on the questions with regard to France
and Great Britain, Jefferson&rsquo;s sympathies being predominantly
with the former, Hamilton&rsquo;s with the latter, they formed about
themselves the two great parties of Democrats and Federalists.
The schools of thought for which they stood have
since contended for mastery in American politics: Hamilton&rsquo;s
gradually strengthened by the necessities of stronger administration,
as time gave widening amplitude and increasing weight to
the specific powers&mdash;and so to Hamilton&rsquo;s great doctrine of
the &ldquo;implied powers&rdquo;&mdash;of the general government of a growing
country; Jefferson&rsquo;s rooted in colonial life, and buttressed by
the hopes and convictions of democracy.</p>

<p>The most perplexing questions treated by Jefferson as secretary
of state arose out of the policy of neutrality adopted by the
United States toward France, to whom she was bound by treaties
and by a heavy debt of gratitude. Separation from European
politics&mdash;the doctrine of &ldquo;America for Americans&rdquo; that was
embodied later in the Monroe declaration&mdash;was a tenet cherished
by Jefferson as by other leaders (not, however, Hamilton) and
by none cherished more firmly, for by nature he was peculiarly
opposed to war, and peace was a fundamental part of his politics.
However deep, therefore, his French sympathies, he drew the
same safe line as did Washington between French politics and
American politics,<a name="fa9h" id="fa9h" href="#ft9h"><span class="sp">9</span></a> and handled the Genet complications to the
satisfaction of even the most partisan Federalists. He expounded,
as a very high authority has said, &ldquo;with remarkable clearness
and power the nature and scope of neutral duty,&rdquo; and gave a
&ldquo;classic&rdquo; statement of the doctrine of recognition.<a name="fa10h" id="fa10h" href="#ft10h"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>But the French question had another side in its reaction on
American parties.<a name="fa11h" id="fa11h" href="#ft11h"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Jefferson did not read excesses in Paris as
warnings against democracy, but as warnings against the abuses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
of monarchy; nor did he regard Bonaparte&rsquo;s <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> as
revealing the weakness of republics, but rather as revealing
the danger of standing armies; he did not look on the war of
the coalitions against France as one of mere powers, but as one
between forms of government; and though the immediate fruits
of the Revolution belied his hopes, as they did those of ardent
humanitarians the world over, he saw the broad trend of history,
which vindicated his faith that a successful reformation of
government in France would insure &ldquo;a general reformation
through Europe, and the resurrection to a new life of their
people.&rdquo; Each of these statements could be reversed as regards
Hamilton. It is the key to an understanding of the times to
remember that the War of Independence had disjointed society;
and democracy&mdash;which Jefferson had proclaimed in the Declaration
of Independence, and enthroned in Virginia&mdash;after strengthening
its rights by the sword, had run to excesses, particularly in
the Shays&rsquo; rebellion, that produced a conservative reaction. To
this reaction Hamilton explicitly appealed in the convention of
1787; and of this reaction various features of the constitution,
and Hamiltonian federalism generally, were direct fruits.
Moreover, independently of special incentives to the alarmist
and the man of property, the opinions of many Americans
turned again, after the war, into a current of sympathy for
England, as naturally as American commerce returned to English
ports. Jefferson, however, far from America in these years
and unexposed to reactionary influences, came back with undiminished
fervour of democracy, and the talk he heard of praise
for England, and fearful recoil before even the beginning of the
revolution in France, disheartened him, and filled him with
suspicion.<a name="fa12h" id="fa12h" href="#ft12h"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Hating as he did feudal class institutions and
Tudor-Stuart traditions of arbitrary rule,<a name="fa13h" id="fa13h" href="#ft13h"><span class="sp">13</span></a> his attitude can be
imagined toward Hamilton&rsquo;s oft-avowed partialities&mdash;and
Jefferson assumed, his intrigues&mdash;for British class-government
with its eighteenth-century measure of corruption. In short,
Hamilton took from recent years the lesson of the evils of lax
government; whereas Jefferson clung to the other lesson, which
crumbling colonial governments had illustrated, that governments
derived their strength (and the Declaration had proclaimed
that they derived their just rights) from the will of the governed.
Each built his system accordingly: the one on the basis of order,
the other on individualism&mdash;which led Jefferson to liberty alike
in religion and in politics. The two men and the fate of the
parties they led are understandable only by regarding one as the
leader of reaction, the other as in line with the American tendencies.
The educated classes characteristically furnished Federalism
with a remarkable body of alarmist leaders; and thus it
happened that Jefferson, because, with only a few of his great
contemporaries, he had a thorough trust and confidence in the
people, became the idol of American democracy.</p>

<p>As Hamilton was somewhat officious and very combative, and
Jefferson, although uncontentious, very suspicious and quite
independent, both men holding inflexibly to opinions, cabinet
harmony became impossible when the two secretaries had formed
parties about them and their differences were carried into the
newspapers;<a name="fa14h" id="fa14h" href="#ft14h"><span class="sp">14</span></a> and Washington abandoned perforce his idea &ldquo;if
parties did exist to reconcile them.&rdquo; Partly from discontent
with a position in which he did not feel that he enjoyed the absolute
confidence of the president,<a name="fa15h" id="fa15h" href="#ft15h"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and partly because of the
embarrassed condition of his private affairs, Jefferson repeatedly
sought to resign, and finally on the 31st of December 1793, with
Washington&rsquo;s reluctant consent, gave up his portfolio and retired
to his home at Monticello, near Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Here he remained improving his estate (having refused a
foreign mission) until elected vice-president in 1796. Jefferson
was never truly happy except in the country. He loved gardening,
experimented enthusiastically in varieties and rotations of
crops and kept meteorological tables with diligence. For eight
years he tabulated with painful accuracy the earliest and latest
appearance of thirty-seven vegetables in the Washington market.
When abroad he sought out varieties of grasses, trees, rice and
olives for American experiment, and after his return from
France received yearly for twenty-three years, from his old friend
the superintendent of the <i>Jardin des plantes</i>, a box of seeds,
which he distributed to public and private gardens throughout
the United States. Jefferson seems to have been the first discoverer
of an exact formula for the construction of mould-boards
of least resistance for ploughs. He managed to make practical
use of his calculus about his farms, and seems to have been remarkably
apt in the practical application of mechanical principles.</p>

<p>In the presidential election of 1796 John Adams, the Federalist
candidate, received the largest number of electoral votes, and
Jefferson, the Republican candidate, the next largest number,
and under the law as it then existed the former became president
and the latter vice-president. Jefferson re-entered public life
with reluctance, though doubtless with keen enough interest and
resolution. He had rightly measured the strength of his followers,
and was waiting for the government to &ldquo;drift into unison&rdquo; with
the republican sense of its constituents, predicting that President
Adams would be &ldquo;overborne&rdquo; thereby. This prediction was
speedily fulfilled. At first the reign of terror and the X. Y. Z.
disclosures strengthened the Federalists, until these, mistaking
the popular resentment against France for a reaction against
democracy&mdash;an equivalence in their own minds&mdash;passed the alien
and sedition laws. In answer to those odious measures Jefferson
and Madison prepared and procured the passage of the Kentucky
and Virginia resolutions. These resolutions later acquired extraordinary
and pernicious prominence in the historical elaboration
of the states&rsquo;-rights doctrine. It is, however, unquestionably
true, that as a startling protest against measures &ldquo;to silence,&rdquo;
in Jefferson&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;by force and not by reason the complaints
or criticisms, just or unjust, of our citizens against the
conduct of our agents,&rdquo; they served, in this respect, a useful
purpose; and as a counterblast against Hamiltonian principles
of centralization they were probably, at that moment, very
salutary; while even as pieces of constitutional interpretation
it is to be remembered that they did not contemplate nullification
by any single state, and, moreover, are not to be judged by
constitutional principles established later by courts and war.
The Federalist party had ruined itself, and it lost the presidential
election of 1800. The Republican candidates, Jefferson and
Aaron Burr (<i>q.v.</i>), receiving equal votes, it devolved upon the
House of Representatives, in accordance with the system which
then obtained, to make one of the two president, the other vice-president.
Party feeling in America has probably never been
more dangerously impassioned than in the three years preceding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
this election; discount as one will the contrary obsessions of
men like Fisher Ames, Hamilton and Jefferson, the time was
fateful. Unable to induce Burr to avow Federalist principles,
influential Federalists, in defiance of the constitution, contemplated
the desperate alternative of preventing an election, and
appointing an extra-constitutional (Federalist) president <i>pro
tempore</i>. Better counsels, however, prevailed; Hamilton used
his influence in favour of Jefferson as against Burr, and Jefferson
became president, entering upon his duties on the 4th of March
1801. Republicans who had affiliated with the Federalists at
the time of the X. Y. Z. disclosures returned; very many of the
Federalists themselves Jefferson placated and drew over. &ldquo;Believing,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;that (excepting the ardent monarchists) all
our citizens agreed in ancient whig principles&rdquo;&mdash;or, as he elsewhere
expressed it, in &ldquo;republican forms&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I thought it
advisable to define and declare them, and let them see the ground
on which we can rally.&rdquo; This he did in his inaugural, which,
though somewhat rhetorical, is a splendid and famous statement
of democracy.<a name="fa16h" id="fa16h" href="#ft16h"><span class="sp">16</span></a> His conciliatory policy produced a mild schism
in his own party, but proved eminently wise, and the state
elections of 1801 fulfilled his prophecy of 1791 that the policy of
the Federalists would leave them &ldquo;all head and no body.&rdquo; In
1804 he was re-elected by 162 out of 176 votes.</p>

<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s administrations were distinguished by the simplicity
that marked his conduct in private life. He eschewed the pomp
and ceremonies, natural inheritances from English origins, that
had been an innocent setting to the character of his two noble
predecessors. His dress was of &ldquo;plain cloth&rdquo; on the day of his
inauguration. Instead of driving to the Capitol in a coach and
six, he walked without a guard or servant from his lodgings&mdash;or,
as a rival tradition has it, he rode, and hitched his horse to a
neighbouring fence&mdash;attended by a crowd of citizens. Instead of
opening Congress with a speech to which a formal reply was
expected, he sent in a written message by a private hand. He
discontinued the practice of sending ministers abroad in public
vessels. Between himself and the governors of states he recognized
no difference in rank. He would not have his birthday
celebrated by state balls. The weekly levée was practically
abandoned. Even such titles as &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; &ldquo;Honourable,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr&rdquo; were distasteful to him. It was formally agreed in cabinet
meeting that &ldquo;when brought together in society, all are perfectly
equal, whether foreign or domestic, titled or untitled, in or out
of office.&rdquo; Thus diplomatic grades were ignored in social precedence
and foreign relations were seriously compromised by
dinner-table complications. One minister who appeared in
gold lace and dress sword for his first, and regularly appointed,
official call on the president, was received&mdash;as he insisted with
studied purpose&mdash;by Jefferson in negligent undress and slippers
down at the heel. All this was in part premeditated system<a name="fa17h" id="fa17h" href="#ft17h"><span class="sp">17</span></a>&mdash;a
part of Jefferson&rsquo;s purpose to republicanize the government
and public opinion, which was the distinguishing feature of his
administration; but it was also simply the nature of the man. In
the company he chose by preference, honesty and knowledge
were his only tests. He knew absolutely no social distinctions in
his willingness to perform services for the deserving. He held up
to his daughter as an especial model the family of a poor but
gifted mechanic as one wherein she would see &ldquo;the best examples
of rational living.&rdquo; &ldquo;If it be possible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be certainly
conscious of anything, I am conscious of feeling no difference
between writing to the highest and lowest being on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s first administration was marked by a reduction of
the army, navy, diplomatic establishment and, to the uttermost,
of governmental expenses; some reduction of the civil service,
accompanied by a large shifting of offices to Republicans; and,
above all, by the Louisiana Purchase (<i>q.v.</i>), following which
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, sent by Jefferson, conducted
their famous exploring expedition across the continent to
the Pacific (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lewis, Meriwether</a></span>). Early in his term he
carried out a policy he had urged upon the government when
minister to France and when vice-president, by dispatching
naval forces to coerce Tripoli into a decent respect for the trade
of his country&mdash;the first in Christendom to gain honourable immunity
from tribute or piracy in the Mediterranean. The
Louisiana Purchase, although the greatest &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo; of
his career, was also an illustration, in corresponding degree, of
his essential practicality, and one of the greatest proofs of his
statesmanship. It was the crowning achievement of his administration.
It is often said that Jefferson established the &ldquo;spoils
system&rdquo; by his changes in the civil service. He was the innovator,
because for the first time there was opportunity for innovation.
But mere justice requires attention to the fact that
incentive to that innovation, and excuse for it, were found in the
absolute one-party monopoly maintained by the Federalists.
Moreover, Jefferson&rsquo;s ideals were high; his reasons for changes
were in general excellent; he at least so far resisted the great
pressure for office&mdash;producing by his resistance dissatisfaction
within his party&mdash;as not to have lowered, apparently, the personnel
of the service; and there were no such blots on his administration
as President Adams&rsquo;s &ldquo;midnight judges.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
his record here was not clear of blots, showing a few regrettable
inconsistencies.<a name="fa18h" id="fa18h" href="#ft18h"><span class="sp">18</span></a> Among important but secondary measures of
his second administration were the extinguishment of Indian
titles, and promotion of Indian emigration to lands beyond the
Mississippi; reorganization of the militia; fortification of the
seaports; reduction of the public debt; and a simultaneous
reduction of taxes. But his second term derives most of its
historical interest from the unsuccessful efforts to convict Aaron
Burr of treasonable acts in the south-west, and from the efforts
made to maintain, without war, the rights of neutrals on the
high seas. In his diplomacy with Napoleon and Great Britain
Jefferson betrayed a painful incorrigibility of optimism. A
national policy of &ldquo;growling before fighting&rdquo;&mdash;later practised
successfully enough by the United States&mdash;was not then possible;
and one writer has very justly said that what chiefly
affects one in the whole matter is the pathos of it&mdash;&ldquo;a philosopher
and a friend of peace struggling with a despot of superhuman
genius, and a Tory cabinet of superhuman insolence
and stolidity&rdquo; (Trent). It is possible to regard the embargo
policy dispassionately as an interesting illustration of Jefferson&rsquo;s
love of peace. The idea&mdash;a very old one with Jefferson&mdash;was
not entirely original; in essence it received other attempted
applications in the Napoleonic period&mdash;and especially in the
continental blockade. Jefferson&rsquo;s statesmanship had the limitations
of an agrarian outlook. The extreme to which he carried
his advocacy of diplomatic isolation, his opposition to the
creation of an adequate navy,<a name="fa19h" id="fa19h" href="#ft19h"><span class="sp">19</span></a> his estimate of cities as &ldquo;sores
upon the body politic,&rdquo; his prejudice against manufactures,
trust in farmers, and political distrust of the artisan class, all
reflect them.</p>

<p>When, on the 4th of March 1809, Jefferson retired from the
presidency, he had been almost continuously in the public
service for forty years. He refused to be re-elected for a third
time, though requested by the legislatures of five states to be a
candidate; and thus, with Washington&rsquo;s prior example, helped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
to establish a precedent deemed by him to be of great importance
under a democratic government. His influence seemed
scarcely lessened in his retirement. Madison and Monroe, his
immediate successors&mdash;neighbours and devoted friends, whom he
had advised in their early education and led in their maturer
years&mdash;consulted him on all great questions, and there was no
break of principles in the twenty-four years of the &ldquo;Jeffersonian
system.&rdquo; Jefferson was one of the greatest political managers
his country has known. He had a quick eye for character, was
genuinely amiable, uncontentious, tactful, masterful; and it
may be assumed from his success that he was wary or shrewd to
a degree. It is true, moreover, that, unless tested by a few
unchanging principles, his acts were often strikingly inconsistent;
and even when so tested, not infrequently remain so in
appearance. Full explanations do not remove from some important
transactions in his political life an impression of indirectness.
But reasonable judgment must find very unjust the stigma
of duplicity put upon him by the Federalists. Measured by the
records of other men equally successful as political leaders,
there seems little of this nature to criticize severely. Jefferson
had the full courage of his convictions. Extreme as were his
principles, his pertinacity in adhering to them and his independence
of expression were quite as extreme. There were philosophic
and philanthropic elements in his political faith which
will always lead some to class him as a visionary and fanatic;
but although he certainly indulged at times in dreams at which
one may still smile, he was not, properly speaking, a visionary;
nor can he with justice be stigmatized as a fanatic. He felt
fervently, was not afraid to risk all on the conclusions to which
his heart and his mind led him, declared himself with openness
and energy; and he spoke and even wrote his conclusions, how
ever bold or abstract, without troubling to detail his reasoning
or clip his off-hand speculations. Certain it is that there is
much in his utterances for a less robust democracy than his own
to cavil at.<a name="fa20h" id="fa20h" href="#ft20h"><span class="sp">20</span></a> Soar, however, as he might, he was essentially not
a doctrinaire, but an empiricist; his mind was objective. Though
he remained, to the end, firm in his belief that there had been
an active monarchist party,<a name="fa21h" id="fa21h" href="#ft21h"><span class="sp">21</span></a> this obsession did not carry him
out of touch with the realities of human nature and of his
time. He built with surety on the colonial past, and had a
better reasoned view of the actual future than had any of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>Events soon appraised the ultra-Federalist judgment of American
democracy, so tersely expressed by Fisher Ames as &ldquo;like
death ... only the dismal passport to a more dismal hereafter&rdquo;;
and, with it, appraised Jefferson&rsquo;s word in his first inaugural
for those who, &ldquo;in the full tide of successful experiment,&rdquo;
were ready to abandon a government that had so far kept
them &ldquo;free and firm, on the visionary fear that it might by
possibility lack energy to preserve itself.&rdquo; Time soon tested,
too, his principle that that government must prove the strongest
on earth &ldquo;where every man ... would meet invasions of the
public order as his own personal concern.&rdquo; He summed up as
follows the difference between himself and the Hamiltonian
group: &ldquo;One feared most the ignorance of the people; the
other the selfishness of rulers independent of them.&rdquo; Jefferson,
in short, had unlimited faith in the honesty of the people; a
large faith in their common sense; believed that all is to be won
by appealing to the reason of voters; that by education their
ignorance can be eliminated; that human nature is indefinitely
perfectible; that majorities rule, therefore, not only by virtue
of force (which was Locke&rsquo;s ultimate justification of them), but
of right.<a name="fa22h" id="fa22h" href="#ft22h"><span class="sp">22</span></a> His importance as a maker of modern America can
scarcely be overstated, for the ideas he advocated have become
the very foundations of American republicanism. His administration
ended the possibility, probability or certainty&mdash;measure
it as one will&mdash;of the development of Federalism in the
direction of class government; and the party he formed, inspired
by the creed he gave it, fixed the democratic future of the
nation. And by his own labours he had vindicated his faith
in the experiment of self-government.</p>

<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s last years were devoted to the establishment of
the university of Virginia at Charlottesville, near his home.
He planned the buildings, gathered its faculty&mdash;mainly from
abroad&mdash;and shaped its organization. Practically all the great
ideas of aim, administration and curriculum that dominated
American universities at the end of the 19th century were anticipated
by him. He hoped that the university might be a dominant
influence in national culture, but circumstances crippled it.
His educational plans had been maturing in his mind since 1776.
His financial affairs in these last years gave him grave concern.
His fine library of over 10,000 volumes was purchased at a low
price by Congress in 1815, and a national contribution ($16,500)
just before his death enabled him to die in peace. Though not
personally extravagant, his salary, and the small income from
his large estates, never sufficed to meet his generous maintenance
of his representative position; and after his retirement from
public life the numerous visitors to Monticello consumed the
remnants of his property. He died on the 4th of July 1826, the
fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, on the
same day as John Adams. He chose for his tomb the epitaph:
&ldquo;Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration
of American Independence, of the statute of Virginia for religious
freedom, and father of the university of Virginia.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Jefferson was about 6 ft. in height, large-boned, slim, erect and
sinewy. He had angular features, a very ruddy complexion, sandy
hair, and hazel-flecked, grey eyes. Age lessened the unattractiveness
of his exterior. In later years he was negligent in dress and
loose in bearing. There was grace, nevertheless, in his manners;
and his frank and earnest address, his quick sympathy (yet he
seemed cold to strangers), his vivacious, desultory, informing talk,
gave him an engaging charm. Beneath a quiet surface he was fairly
aglow with intense convictions and a very emotional temperament.
Yet he seems to have acted habitually, in great and little things,
on system. His mind, no less trenchant and subtle than Hamilton&rsquo;s,
was the most impressible, the most receptive, mind of his time in
America. The range of his interests is remarkable. For many years
he was president of the American philosophical society. Though it is
a biographical tradition that he lacked wit, Molière and <i>Don Quixote</i>
seem to have been his favourites; and though the utilitarian wholly
crowds romanticism out of his writings, he had enough of that
quality in youth to prepare to learn Gaelic in order to translate
Ossian, and sent to Macpherson for the originals! His interest
in art was evidently intellectual. He was singularly sweet-tempered,
and shrank from the impassioned political bitterness that raged
about him; bore with relative equanimity a flood of coarse and
malignant abuse of his motives, morals, religion,<a name="fa23h" id="fa23h" href="#ft23h"><span class="sp">23</span></a> personal honesty
and decency; cherished very few personal animosities; and better
than any of his great antagonists cleared political opposition of ill-blooded
personality. In short, his kindness of heart rose above all
social, religious or political differences, and nothing destroyed his
confidence in men and his sanguine views of life.</p>

<p><a name="ft5h" id="ft5h" href="#fa5h"><span class="fn">5</span></a> This plan applied to the south-western as well as to the north-western
territory, and was notable for a provision that slavery
should not exist therein after 1800. This provision was defeated
in 1784, but was adopted in 1787 for the north-western territory&mdash;a
step which is very often said to have saved the Union in the Civil
War; the south-western territory (out of which were later formed
Mississippi, Alabama, &amp;c.) being given over to slavery. Thus the
anti-slavery clause of the ordinance of 1784 was not adopted; and
it was preceded by unofficial proposals to the same end; yet to it
belongs rightly some special honour as blazoning the way for federal
control of slavery in the territories, which later proved of such
enormous consequence. Jefferson in the first draft of the Ordinance
of 1784, suggested the names to be given to the states eventually
to be formed out of the territory concerned. For his suggestions
he has been much ridiculed. The names are as follows: Illinoia,
Michigania, Sylvania, Polypotamia, Assenisipia, Charronesus,
Pelisipia, Saratoga, Metropotamia and Washington.</p>

<p><a name="ft6h" id="ft6h" href="#fa6h"><span class="fn">6</span></a> He owned at one time above 150 slaves. His overseers were
under contract never to bleed them; but he manumitted only a few
at his death.</p>

<p><a name="ft7h" id="ft7h" href="#fa7h"><span class="fn">7</span></a> During this time he assisted in negotiating a treaty of amity
and commerce with Prussia (1785) and one with Morocco (1789),
and negotiated with France a &ldquo;convention defining and establishing
the functions and privileges of consuls and vice-consuls&rdquo; (1788).</p>

<p><a name="ft8h" id="ft8h" href="#fa8h"><span class="fn">8</span></a> Patrick Henry humorously declaimed before a popular audience
that Jefferson, who favoured French wine and cookery, had &ldquo;abjured
his native victuals.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="ft9h" id="ft9h" href="#fa9h"><span class="fn">9</span></a> Jefferson did not sympathize with the temper of his followers
who condoned the zealous excesses of Genet, and in general with the
&ldquo;misbehaviour&rdquo; of the democratic clubs; but, as a student of English
liberties, he could not accept Washington&rsquo;s doctrine that for a
self-created permanent body to declare &ldquo;this act unconstitutional,
and that act pregnant with mischiefs&rdquo; was &ldquo;a stretch of arrogant
presumption&rdquo; which would, if unchecked, &ldquo;destroy the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="ft12h" id="ft12h" href="#fa12h"><span class="fn">12</span></a> It was at this period of his life that Jefferson gave expression
to some of the opinions for which he has been most severely
criticized and ridiculed. For the Shays&rsquo; rebellion he felt little abhorrence,
and wrote: &ldquo;A little rebellion now and then is a good thing ... an
observation of this truth should render honest republican
governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions as not to discourage
them too much. It is a medicine necessary for the sound
health of government&rdquo; (<i>Writings</i>, Ford ed., iv. 362-363). Again,
&ldquo;Can history produce an instance of rebellion so honorably conducted?... God
forbid that we should ever be twenty years
without such a rebellion.... What signify a few lives lost in a
century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time
to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural
manure&rdquo; (Ibid. iv. 467). Again he says: &ldquo;Societies exist under
three forms&mdash;(1) without government, as among our Indians; (2)
under governments wherein the will of every one has a just influence.... (3)
under governments of force.... It is a problem not
clear in my mind that the first condition is not the best.&rdquo; (Ibid.
iv. 362.)</p>

<p><a name="ft13h" id="ft13h" href="#fa13h"><span class="fn">13</span></a> He turned law students from Blackstone&rsquo;s toryism to Coke on
Littleton; and he would not read Walter Scott, so strong was his
aversion to that writer&rsquo;s predilection for class and feudalism.</p>

<p><a name="ft14h" id="ft14h" href="#fa14h"><span class="fn">14</span></a> Hamilton wrote for the papers himself; Jefferson never did.
A talented clerk in his department, however, Philip Freneau, set up
an anti-administration paper. It was alleged that Jefferson appointed
him for the purpose, and encouraged him. Undoubtedly
there was nothing in the charge. The Federalist outcry could only
have been silenced by removal of Freneau, or by disclaimers or
admonitions, which Jefferson did not think it incumbent upon
himself&mdash;or, since he thought Freneau was doing good, desirable for
him&mdash;to make.</p>

<p><a name="ft15h" id="ft15h" href="#fa15h"><span class="fn">15</span></a> Contrary to the general belief that Hamilton dominated Washington
in the cabinet, there is the president&rsquo;s explicit statement that
&ldquo;there were as many instances&rdquo; of his deciding against as in favour
of the secretary of the treasury.</p>

vii. 325), and to Dupont de Nemours (x. 23). Cf. Hamilton to
J. Dayton, 1799 (<i>Works</i>, x. 329).</p>

<p><a name="ft17h" id="ft17h" href="#fa17h"><span class="fn">17</span></a> In 1786 he suggested to James Monroe that the society of
friends he hoped to gather in Albemarle might, in sumptuary
matters, &ldquo;set a good example&rdquo; to a country (<i>i.e.</i> Virginia) that
&ldquo;needed&rdquo; it.</p>

Historical Studies, New York, 1905), ch. 2.</p>

<p><a name="ft19h" id="ft19h" href="#fa19h"><span class="fn">19</span></a> Jefferson&rsquo;s dislike of a navy was due to his desire for an economical
administration and for peace. Shortly after his inauguration he
expressed a desire to lay up the larger men of war in the eastern
branch of the Potomac, where they would require only &ldquo;one set
of plunderers to take care of them.&rdquo; To Thomas Paine he wrote
in 1807: &ldquo;I believe that gunboats are the only <i>water</i> defence which
can be useful to us and protect us from the ruinous folly of a navy.&rdquo;
(<i>Works</i>, Ford ed., ix. 137.) The gunboats desired by Jefferson
were small, cheap craft equipped with one or two guns and kept on
shore under sheds until actually needed, when they were to be
launched and manned by a sort of naval militia. A large number
of these boats were constructed and they afforded some protection
to coasting vessels against privateers, but in bad weather, or when
employed against a frigate, they were worse than useless, and
Jefferson&rsquo;s &ldquo;gunboat system&rdquo; was admittedly a failure.</p>

<p><a name="ft20h" id="ft20h" href="#fa20h"><span class="fn">20</span></a> See <i>e.g.</i> his letters in 1787 on the Shays&rsquo; rebellion, and his speculations
on the doctrine that one generation may not bind another
by paper documents. With the latter may be compared present-day
movements like the initiative and referendum, and not a few
discussions of national debts. Jefferson&rsquo;s distrust of governments
was nothing exceptional for a consistent individualist.</p>

<p><a name="ft21h" id="ft21h" href="#fa21h"><span class="fn">21</span></a> In his last years he carefully sifted and revised his contemporary
notes evidencing, as he believed, the existence of such a party, and
they remain as his <i>Ana</i> (chiefly Hamiltoniana). The only just
judgment of these notes is to be obtained by looking at them,
and by testing his suspicions with the letters of Hamilton, Ames,
Oliver Wolcott, Theodore Sedgwick, George Cabot and the other
Hamiltonians. Such a comparison measures also the relative
judgment, temper and charity of these writers and Jefferson. It
must still remain true, however, that Jefferson&rsquo;s <i>Ana</i> present him
in a far from engaging light.</p>

<p><a name="ft22h" id="ft22h" href="#fa22h"><span class="fn">22</span></a> &ldquo;Jefferson, in 1789, wrote some such stuff about the will of
majorities, as a New Englander would lose his rank among men of
sense to avow.&rdquo;&mdash;Fisher Ames (Jan. 1800).</p>

<p><a name="ft23h" id="ft23h" href="#fa23h"><span class="fn">23</span></a> He was classed as a &ldquo;French infidel&rdquo; and atheist. His attitude
toward religion was in fact deeply reverent and sincere, but he
insisted that religion was purely an individual matter, &ldquo;evidenced,
as concerns the world by each one&rsquo;s daily life,&rdquo; and demanded
absolute freedom of private judgment. He looked on Unitarianism
with much sympathy and desired its growth. &ldquo;I am a Christian,&rdquo;
he wrote in 1823, &ldquo;in the only sense in which he (Jesus) wished any
one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all
others; ascribing to himself every human excellence, and believing
he never claimed any other.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEFFERSON CITY<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (legally and officially the City of Jefferson),
the capital of Missouri, U.S.A., and the county-seat of Cole
county, on the Missouri river, near the geographical centre of the
state, about 125 m. W. of St Louis. Pop. (1890), 6742; (1900),
9664, of whom 786 were foreign-born and 1822 were negroes;
(1910 census), 11,850. It is served by the Missouri Pacific,
the Chicago &amp; Alton, and the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas
railways. Its site is partly in the bottom-lands of the river and
partly on the steep banks at an elevation of about 600 ft. above
the sea. A steel bridge spans the river. The state capitol, an
imposing structure built on a bluff above the river, was built in
1838-1842 and enlarged in 1887-1888; it was first occupied in
1840 by the legislature, which previously had met (after 1837)
in the county court house. Other prominent buildings are the
United States court house and post office, the state supreme court
house, the county court house, the state penitentiary, the state
armoury and the executive mansion. The penitentiary is to a
large extent self-supporting; in 1903-1904 the earnings were
$3493.80 in excess of the costs, but in 1904-1906 the costs
exceeded the earnings by $9044. Employment is furnished for
the convicts on the <span class="correction" title="amended from pentitentiary">penitentiary</span> premises by incorporated
companies. The state law library here is one of the best of
the kind in the country, and the city has a public library.
In the city is Lincoln Institute, a school for negroes, founded
in 1866 by two regiments of negro infantry upon their discharge
from the United States army, opened in 1868, taken over
by the state in 1879, and having sub-normal, normal, college,
industrial and agricultural courses. Coal and limestone are
found near the city. In 1905 the total value of the factory
product was $3,926,632, an increase of 28.2% since 1900.
The original constitution of Missouri prescribed that the capital
should be on the Missouri river within 40 m. of the mouth
of the Osage, and a commission selected in 1821 the site of
Jefferson City, on which a town was laid out in 1822, the name
being adopted in honour of Thomas Jefferson. The legislature
first met here in 1826; Jefferson City became the county-seat in
1828, and in 1839 was first chartered as a city. The constitutional
conventions of 1845 and 1875, and the state convention
which issued the call for the National Liberal Republican convention
at Cincinnati in 1872, met here, and so for some of its
sessions did the state convention of 1861-1863. In June 1861
Jefferson City was occupied by Union forces, and in September-October
1864 it was threatened by Confederate troops under
General Sterling Price.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEFFERSONVILLE,<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Clark
county, Indiana, U.S.A., situated on the N. bank of the Ohio
river, opposite Louisville, Kentucky, with which it is connected
by several bridges. Pop. (1890), 10,666; (1900), 10,774, of
whom 1818 were of negro descent and 615 were foreign-born;
(1910 census), 10,412. It is served by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
South-western, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis,
and the Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis railways,
and by three inter-urban electric lines. It is attractively situated
on bluffs above the river, which at this point has a descent
(known as the falls of the Ohio) of 26 ft. in 2 m. This furnishes
good water power for manufacturing purposes both at Jeffersonville
and at Louisville. The total value of the factory product
in 1905 was $4,526,443, an increase of 20% since 1900. The
Indiana reformatory (formerly the Southern Indiana penitentiary)
and a large supply dépôt of the United States army are at
Jeffersonville. General George Rogers Clark started (June 24,
1778) on his expedition against Kaskaskia and Vincennes from
Corn Island (now completely washed away) opposite what is
now Jeffersonville. In 1786 the United States government
established Fort Finney (built by Captain Walter Finney), afterwards
re-named Fort Steuben, on the site of the present city;
but the fort was abandoned in 1791, and the actual beginning
of Jeffersonville was in 1802, when a part of the Clark grant
(the site of the present city) was transferred by its original
owner, Lieut. Isaac Bowman, to three trustees, under whose
direction a town was laid out. Jeffersonville was incorporated
as a town in 1815, and was chartered as a city in 1839.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEFFREY, FRANCIS JEFFREY,<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> <span class="sc">Lord</span> (1773-1850), Scottish
judge and literary critic, son of a depute-clerk in the Court of
Session, was born at Edinburgh on the 23rd of October 1773.
After attending the high school for six years, he studied at the
university of Glasgow from 1787 to May 1789, and at Queen&rsquo;s
College, Oxford, from September 1791 to June 1792. He had
begun the study of law at Edinburgh before going to Oxford,
and now resumed his studies there. He became a member of
the speculative society, where he measured himself in debate
with Scott, Brougham, Francis Horner, the marquess of Lansdowne,
Lord Kinnaird and others. He was admitted to the
Scotch bar in December 1794, but, having abandoned the Tory
principles in which he had been educated, he found that his
Whig politics seriously prejudiced his legal prospects. In consequence
of his lack of success at the bar he went to London in
1798 to try his fortune as a journalist, but without success; he
also made more than one vain attempt to obtain an office which
would have secured him the advantage of a small but fixed
salary. His marriage with Catherine Wilson in 1801 made the
question of a settled income even more pressing. A project for a
new review was brought forward by Sydney Smith in Jeffrey&rsquo;s flat
in the presence of H. P. Brougham (afterwards Lord Brougham),
Francis Horner and others; and the scheme resulted in the
appearance on the 10th of October 1802 of the first number of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>. At the outset the <i>Review</i> was not under
the charge of any special editor. The first three numbers were,
however, practically edited by Sydney Smith, and on his leaving
for England the work devolved chiefly on Jeffrey, who, by an
arrangement with Constable, the publisher, was eventually
appointed editor at a fixed salary. Most of those associated in
the undertaking were Whigs; but, although the general bias of
the Review was towards social and political reforms, it was at
first so little of a party organ that for a time it numbered Sir
Walter Scott among its contributors; and no distinct emphasis
was given to its political leanings until the publication in 1808 of
an article by Jeffrey himself on the work of Don Pedro Cevallos
on the <i>French Usurpation of Spain</i>. This article expressed
despair of the success of the British arms in Spain, and Scott at
once withdrew his subscription, the <i>Quarterly</i> being soon afterwards
started in opposition. According to Lord Cockburn the
effect of the first number of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was &ldquo;electrical.&rdquo;
The English reviews were at that time practically
publishers&rsquo; organs, the articles in which were written by hackwriters
instructed to praise or blame according to the publishers&rsquo;
interests. Few men of any standing consented to write for
them. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, on the other hand, enlisted a
brilliant and independent staff of contributors, guided by the
editor, not the publisher. They received sixteen guineas a
sheet (sixteen printed pages), increased subsequently to twenty-five
guineas in many cases, instead of the two guineas which
formed the ordinary London reviewer&rsquo;s fee. Further, the review
was not limited to literary criticism. It constituted itself the
accredited organ of moderate Whig public opinion. The particular
work which provided the starting-point of an article was in
many cases merely the occasion for the exposition, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
brilliant and incisive, of the author&rsquo;s views on politics, social
subjects, ethics or literature. These general principles and the
novelty of the method ensured the success of the undertaking
even after the original circle of exceptionally able men who
founded it had been dispersed. It had a circulation, great for
those days, of 12,000 copies. The period of Jeffrey&rsquo;s editorship
extended to about twenty-six years, ceasing with the ninety-eighth
number, published in June 1829, when he resigned in
favour of Macvey Napier.</p>

<p>Jeffrey&rsquo;s own contributions, according to a list which has the
sanction of his authority, numbered two hundred, all except
six being written before his resignation of the editorship. Jeffrey
wrote with great rapidity, at odd moments of leisure and with
little special preparation. Great fluency and ease of diction,
considerable warmth of imagination and moral sentiment, and
a sharp eye to discover any oddity of style or violation of the
accepted canons of good taste, made his criticisms pungent and
effective. But the essential narrowness and timidity of his
general outlook prevented him from detecting and estimating
latent forces, either in politics or in matters strictly intellectual
and moral; and this lack of understanding and sympathy accounts
for his distrust and dislike of the passion and fancy of
Shelley and Keats, and for his praise of the half-hearted and elegant
romanticism of Rogers and Campbell. (For his treatment
of the lake poets see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wordsworth, William</a></span>.)</p>

<p>A criticism in the fifteenth number of the <i>Review</i> on the
morality of Moore&rsquo;s poems led in 1806 to a duel between the two
authors at Chalk Farm. The proceedings were stopped by the
police, and Jeffrey&rsquo;s pistol was found to contain no bullet. The
affair led to a warm friendship, however, and Moore contributed
to the <i>Review</i>, while Jeffrey made ample amends in a later article
on <i>Lalla Rookh</i> (1817).</p>

<p>Jeffrey&rsquo;s wife had died in 1805, and in 1810 he became acquainted
with Charlotte, daughter of Charles Wilkes of New
York, and great-niece of John Wilkes. When she returned to
America, Jeffrey followed her, and they were married in 1813.
Before returning to England they visited several of the chief
American cities, and his experience strengthened Jeffrey in the
conciliatory policy he had before advocated towards the States.
Notwithstanding the increasing success of the <i>Review</i>, Jeffrey
always continued to look to the bar as the chief field of his ambition.
As a matter of fact, his literary reputation helped his
professional advancement. His practice extended rapidly in
the civil and criminal courts, and he regularly appeared before
the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, where his work,
though not financially profitable, increased his reputation. As
an advocate his sharpness and rapidity of insight gave him a formidable
advantage in the detection of the weaknesses of a witness
and the vulnerable points of his opponent&rsquo;s case, while he grouped
his own arguments with an admirable eye to effect, especially
excelling in eloquent closing appeals to a jury. Jeffrey was
twice, in 1820 and 1822, elected lord rector of the university of
Glasgow. In 1829 he was chosen dean of the faculty of advocates.
On the return of the Whigs to power in 1830 he became lord
advocate, and entered parliament as member for the Perth
burghs. He was unseated, and afterwards returned for Malton,
a borough in the interest of Lord Fitzwilliam. After the passing
of the Scottish Reform Bill, which he introduced in parliament,
he was returned for Edinburgh in December 1832. His parliamentary
career, which, though not brilliantly successful, had
won him high general esteem, was terminated by his elevation
to the judicial bench as Lord Jeffrey in May 1834. In 1842 he
was moved to the first division of the Court of Session. On the
disruption of the Scottish Church he took the side of the seceders,
giving a judicial opinion in their favour, afterwards reversed by
the house of lords. He died at Edinburgh on the 26th of January
1850.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEFFREYS, GEORGE JEFFREYS,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1648-1689),
lord chancellor of England, son of John Jeffreys, a Welsh country
gentleman, was born at Acton Park, his father&rsquo;s seat in Denbighshire,
in 1648. His family, though not wealthy, was of good
social standing and repute in Wales; his mother, a daughter of
Sir Thomas Ireland of Bewsey, Lancashire, was &ldquo;a very pious
good woman.&rdquo; He was educated at Shrewsbury, St Paul&rsquo;s
and Westminster schools, at the last of which he was a pupil
of Busby, and at Trinity College, Cambridge; but he left the
university without taking a degree, and entered the Inner
Temple as a student in May 1663. From his childhood Jeffreys
displayed exceptional talent, but on coming to London he
occupied himself more with the pleasures of conviviality than
with serious study of the law. Though he never appears to
have fallen into the licentious immorality prevalent at that
period, he early became addicted to hard drinking and boisterous
company. But as the records of his early years, and indeed of his
whole life, are derived almost exclusively from vehemently hostile
sources, the numerous anecdotes of his depravity cannot be
accepted without a large measure of scepticism. He was a
handsome, witty and attractive boon-companion, and in the
taverns of the city he made friends among attorneys with
practice in the criminal courts. Thus assisted he rose so rapidly
in his profession that within three years of his call to the bar
in 1668, he was elected common serjeant of the city of London.
Such advancement, however, was not to be attained even in
the reign of Charles II. solely by the aid of disreputable friendships.
Jeffreys had remarkable aptitude for the profession of
an advocate&mdash;quick intelligence, caustic humour, copious eloquence.
His powers of cross-examination were masterly;
and if he was insufficiently grounded in legal principles to become
a profound lawyer, nothing but greater application was needed in
the opinion of so hostile a critic as Lord Campbell, to have made
him the rival of Nottingham and Hale. Jeffreys could count
on the influence of respectable men of position in the city, such as
Sir Robert Clayton and his own namesake Alderman Jeffreys;
and he also enjoyed the personal friendship of the virtuous
Sir Matthew Hale. In 1667 Jeffreys had married in circumstances
which, if improvident, were creditable to his generosity
and sense of honour; and his domestic life, so far as is known,
was free from the scandal common among his contemporaries.
While holding the judicial office of common serjeant, he pursued
his practice at the bar. With a view to further preferment
he now sought to ingratiate himself with the court party,
to which he obtained an introduction possibly through William
Chiffinch, the notorious keeper of the king&rsquo;s closet. He at once
attached himself to the king&rsquo;s mistress, the duchess of Portsmouth;
and as early as 1672 he was employed in confidential
business by the court. His influence in the city of London,
where opposition to the government of Charles II. was now becoming
pronounced, enabled Jeffreys to make himself useful to
Danby. In September 1677 he received a knighthood, and his
growing favour with the court was further marked by his
appointment as solicitor-general to James, duke of York; while
the city showed its continued confidence in him by electing
him to the post of recorder in October 1678.</p>

<p>In the previous month Titus Oates had made his first revelations
of the alleged popish plot, and from this time forward
Jeffreys was prominently identified, either as advocate or
judge, with the memorable state trials by which the political
conflict between the Crown and the people was waged during
the remainder of the 17th century. The popish plot, followed
by the growing agitation for the exclusion of the duke of
York from the succession, widened the breach between the city
and the court. Jeffreys threw in his lot with the latter, displaying
his zeal by initiating the movement of the &ldquo;abhorrers&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>)
against the &ldquo;petitioners&rdquo; who were giving voice to the popular
demand for the summoning of parliament. He was rewarded
with the coveted office of chief justice of Chester on the 30th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
of April 1680; but when parliament met in October the House of
Commons passed a hostile resolution which induced him to
resign his recordership, a piece of pusillanimity that drew from
the king the remark that Jeffreys was &ldquo;not parliament-proof.&rdquo;
Jeffreys nevertheless received from the city aldermen a substantial
token of appreciation for his past services. In 1681 he was
created a baronet. In June 1683 the first of the Rye House conspirators
were brought to trial. Jeffreys was briefed for the
crown in the prosecution of Lord William Howard; and, having
been raised to the bench as lord chief justice of the king&rsquo;s
bench in September, he presided at the trials of Algernon Sidney
in November 1683 and of Sir Thomas Armstrong in the following
June. In the autumn of 1684 Jeffreys, who had been active in
procuring the surrender of municipal charters to the crown,
was called to the cabinet, having previously been sworn of the
privy council. In May 1685 he had the satisfaction of passing
sentence on Titus Oates for perjury in the plot trials; and about
the same time James II. rewarded his zeal with a peerage as
Baron Jeffreys of Wem, an honour never before conferred on a
chief justice during his tenure of office. Jeffreys had for some
time been suffering from stone, which aggravated the irritability
of his naturally violent temper; and the malady probably
was in some degree the cause of the unmeasured fury he displayed
at the trial of Richard Baxter (<i>q.v.</i>) for seditious libel&mdash;if
the unofficial <i>ex parte</i> report of the trial, which alone exists,
is to be accepted as trustworthy.</p>

<p>In August 1685 Jeffreys opened at Winchester the commission
known in history as the &ldquo;bloody assizes,&rdquo; his conduct of which
has branded his name with indelible infamy. The number
of persons sentenced to death at these assizes for complicity in
the duke of Monmouth&rsquo;s insurrection is uncertain. The official
return of those actually executed was 320; many hundreds
more were transported and sold into slavery in the West Indies.
In all probability the great majority of those condemned were
in fact concerned in the rising, but the trials were in many
cases a mockery of the administration of justice. Numbers were
cajoled into pleading guilty; the case for the prisoners seldom
obtained a hearing. The merciless severity of the chief justice
did not however exceed the wishes of James II.; for on his return
to London Jeffreys received from the king the great seal with
the title of lord chancellor. For the next two years he was a
strenuous upholder of prerogative, though he was less abjectly
pliant than has sometimes been represented. There is no reason
to doubt the sincerity of his attachment to the Church of England;
for although the king&rsquo;s favour was capricious Jeffreys never took
the easy and certain path to secure it that lay through apostasy;
and he even withstood James on occasion, when the latter
pushed his Catholic zeal to extremes. Though it is true that
he accepted the presidency of the ecclesiastical commission,
Burnet&rsquo;s statement that it was Jeffreys who suggested that
institution to James is probably incorrect; and he was so far
from having instigated the prosecution of the seven bishops in
1688, as has been frequently alleged, that he disapproved
of the proceedings and rejoiced secretly at the acquittal. But
while he watched with misgiving the king&rsquo;s preferment of Roman
Catholics, he made himself the masterful instrument of unconstitutional
prerogative in coercing the authorities of Cambridge
University, who in 1687 refused to confer degrees on a
Benedictine monk, and the fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford,
who declined to elect as their president a disreputable nominee
of the king.</p>

<p>Being thus conspicuously identified with the most tyrannical
measures of James II., Jeffreys found himself in a desperate
plight when on the 11th of December 1688 the king fled from
the country on the approach to London of William of Orange.
The lord chancellor attempted to escape like his master; but
in spite of his disguise as a common seaman he was recognized
in a tavern at Wapping&mdash;possibly, as Roger North relates, by an
attorney whom Jeffreys had terrified on some occasion in the
court of chancery&mdash;and was arrested and conveyed to the
Tower. The malady from which he had long suffered had
recently made fatal progress, and he died in the Tower on
the 18th of April 1689. He was succeeded in the peerage by his
son, John (2nd Baron Jeffreys of Wem), who died without male
issue in 1702, when the title became extinct.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine precisely with what justice
tradition has made the name of &ldquo;Judge Jeffreys&rdquo; a byword of
infamy. The Revolution, which brought about his fall, handed
over his reputation at the same time to the mercy of his bitterest
enemies. They alone have recorded his actions and appraised his
motives and character. Even the adherents of the deposed
dynasty had no interest in finding excuse for one who served as
a convenient scapegoat for the offences of his master. For at
least half a century after his death no apology for Lord Jeffreys
would have obtained a hearing; and none was attempted.
With the exception therefore of what is to be gathered from the
reports of the state trials, all knowledge of his conduct rests
on testimony tainted by undisguised hostility. Innumerable
scurrilous lampoons vilifying the hated instrument of James&rsquo;s
tyranny, but without a pretence of historic value, flooded the
country at the Revolution; and these, while they fanned the
undiscriminating hatred of contemporaries who remembered
the judge&rsquo;s severities, and perpetuated that hatred in tradition,
have not been sufficiently discounted even by modern historians
like Macaulay and Lord Campbell. The name of Jeffreys has
therefore been handed down as that of a coarse, ignorant,
dissolute, foul-mouthed, inhuman bully, who prostituted the
seat of justice. That there was sufficient ground for the execration
in which his memory was long held is not to be gainsaid.
But the portrait has nevertheless been blackened overmuch.
An occasional significant admission in his favour may be gleaned
even from the writings of his enemies. Thus Roger North
declares that &ldquo;in matters indifferent,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> where politics were
not concerned, Jeffreys became the seat of justice better than any
other that author had seen in his place. Sir J. Jekyll, master
of the rolls, told Speaker Onslow that Jeffreys &ldquo;had great parts
and made a great chancellor in the business of his court. In
mere private matters he was thought an able and upright judge
wherever he sat.&rdquo; His keen sense of humour, allied with a spirit
of inveterate mockery and an exuberant command of pungent
eloquence, led him to rail and storm at prisoners and witnesses in
grossly unseemly fashion. But in this he did not greatly surpass
most of his contemporaries on the judicial bench, and it was
a failing from which even the dignified and virtuous Hale was not
altogether exempt. The intemperance of Jeffreys which shocked
North, certainly did not exceed that of Saunders; in violence he
was rivalled by Scroggs; though accused of political apostasy,
he was not a shameless renegade like Williams; and there is
no evidence that in pecuniary matters he was personally venal,
or that in licentiousness he followed the example set by
Charles II. and most of his courtiers. Some of his actions
that have incurred the sternest reprobation of posterity were
otherwise estimated by the best of his contemporaries. His
trial of Algernon Sidney, described by Macaulay and Lord
Campbell as one of the most heinous of his iniquities, was warmly
commended by Dr William Lloyd, who was soon afterwards
to become a popular idol as one of the illustrious seven bishops
(see letter from the bishop of St Asaph in H. B. Irving&rsquo;s <i>Life of
Judge Jeffreys</i>, p. 184). Nor was the habitual illegality of his
procedure on the bench so unquestionable as many writers have
assumed. Sir James Stephen inclined to the opinion that no
actual abuse of law tainted the trials of the Rye House conspirators,
or that of Alice Lisle, the most prominent victim of the
&ldquo;bloody assizes.&rdquo; The conduct of the judges in Russell&rsquo;s trial
was, he thinks, &ldquo;moderate and fair in general&rdquo;; and the trial
of Sidney &ldquo;much resembled that of Russell.&rdquo; The same high
authority pronounces that the trial of Lord Delamere in the
House of Lords was conducted by Jeffreys &ldquo;with propriety and
dignity.&rdquo; And if Jeffreys judged political offenders with cruel
severity, he also crushed some glaring abuses; conspicuous
examples of which were the frauds of attorneys who infested
Westminster Hall, and the systematic kidnapping practised
by the municipal authorities of Bristol. Moreover, if any
value is to be attached to the evidence of physiognomy, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
traditional estimate of the character of Jeffreys obtains no confirmation
from the refinement of his features and expression as
depicted in Kneller&rsquo;s portrait in the National Portrait Gallery
of London. But even though the popular notion requires
to be thus modified in certain respects, it remains incontestable
that Jeffreys was probably on the whole the worst example of a
period when the administration of justice in England had sunk
to the lowest degradation, and the judicial bench had become
the too willing tool of an unconstitutional and unscrupulous
executive.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;The chief contemporary authorities for the life
of Jeffreys are Bishop Burnet&rsquo;s <i>History of my own Time</i> (1724), and
see especially the edition &ldquo;with notes by the Earls of Dartmouth and
Hardwick Speaker Onslow and Dean Swift&rdquo; (Oxford Univ. Press,
1833); Roger North&rsquo;s <i>Life of the Right Hon. Francis North, Baron of
Guildford</i> (1808) and <i>Autobiography</i> (ed. by Augustus Jessopp, 1887);
<i>Ellis Correspondence, Verney Papers</i> (Hist. MSS. Comm.), <i>Hatton
Correspondence</i> (Camden Soc. pub.); the earl of Ailesbury&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>;
Evelyn&rsquo;s <i>Diary</i>. The only trustworthy information as to the judicial
conduct and capacity of Jeffreys is to be found in the reports of the
<i>State Trials</i>, vols. vii.-xii.; and cf. Sir J. F. Stephen&rsquo;s <i>History of the
Criminal Law of England</i> (1883). For details of the &ldquo;bloody assizes,&rdquo;
see <i>Harl. MSS.</i>, 4689; George Roberts, <i>The Life, Progresses and
Rebellion of James Duke of Monmouth</i>, vol. ii. (1844); also many
pamphlets, lampoons, &amp;c., in the British Museum, as to which see
the article on &ldquo;Sources of History for Monmouth&rsquo;s Rebellion and the
Bloody Assizes,&rdquo; by A. L. Humphreys, in <i>Proceedings of the Somersetshire
Archaeological and Natural Hist. Soc.</i> (1892). Later accounts are
by H. W. Woolrych, <i>Memoirs of the Life of Judge Jeffreys</i> (1827); Lord
Campbell, <i>The Lives of the Lord Chancellors</i> (1845), 1st series, vol. iii.;
E. Foss, <i>The Judges of England</i> (1864), vol. vii.; Henry Roscoe, <i>Lives
of Eminent British Lawyers</i> (1830); Lord Macaulay, <i>History of England</i>
(1848; and many subsequent editions). Most of these works, and
especially those by Macaulay and Campbell, are uncritical in their
hostility to Jeffreys, and are based for the most part on untrustworthy
authorities. The best modern work on the subject, though
unduly favourable to Jeffreys, is H. B. Irving&rsquo;s <i>Life of Judge Jeffreys</i>
(1898), the appendix to which contains a full bibliography.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEHOIACHIN<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (Heb. &ldquo;Yah[weh] establisheth&rdquo;), in the Bible,
son of Jehoiakim and king of Judah (2 Kings xxiv. 8 sqq.;
2 Chron, xxxvi. 9 seq.). He came to the throne at the age of
eighteen in the midst of the Chaldean invasion of Judah, and is
said to have reigned three months. He was compelled to surrender
to Nebuchadrezzar and was carried off to Babylon
(597 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). This was the First Captivity, and from it Ezekiel
(one of the exiles) dates his prophecies. Eight thousand people
of the better class (including artisans, &amp;c.) were removed,
the Temple was partially despoiled (see Jer. xxvii. 18-20;
xxiii.v. 3 seq.),<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and Jehoiachin&rsquo;s uncle Mattaniah (son of Josiah)
was appointed king. Jehoiachin&rsquo;s fate is outlined in Jer. xxii.
20-30 (cf. xxvii. 20). Nearly forty years later, Nebuchadrezzar
II. died (562 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and Evil-Merodach (Amil-Marduk) his
successor released the unfortunate captive and gave him precedence
over the other subjugated kings who were kept prisoners
in Babylon. With this gleam of hope for the unhappy Judaeans
both the book of Kings and the prophecies of Jeremiah conclude
(2 Kings xxv. 27-30; Jer. lii. 31-34).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEHOIAKIM<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (Heb. &ldquo;Yah[weh] raiseth up&rdquo;), in the Bible,
son of Josiah (<i>q.v.</i>) and king of Judah (2 Kings xxiii. 34-xxiv. 6).
On the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo his younger brother Jehoahaz
(or Shallum) was chosen by the Judaeans, but the Egyptian
conquerer Necho summoned him to his headquarters at Riblah
(south of Hamath on the Orontes) and removed him to Egypt,
appointing in his stead Eliakim, whose name (&ldquo;El [God] raiseth
up&rdquo;) was changed to its better-known synonym, Jehoiakim.
For a time Jehoiakim remained under the protection of Necho
and paid heavy tribute; but with the rise of the new Chaldean
Empire under Nebuchadrezzar II., and the overthrow of Egypt
at the battle of Carchemish (605 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) a vital change occurred.
After three years of allegiance the king revolted. Invasions
followed by Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Ammonites, perhaps
the advance troops despatched by the Babylonian king;
the power of Egypt was broken and the whole land came into
the hands of Nebuchadrezzar. It was at the close of Jehoiakim&rsquo;s
reign, apparently just before his death, that the enemy appeared
at the gates of Jerusalem, and although he himself &ldquo;slept with
his fathers&rdquo; his young son was destined to see the first captivity
of the land of Judah (597 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jehoiachin</a></span>.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Which &ldquo;three years&rdquo; (2 Kings xxiv. 1) are intended is disputed;
it is uncertain whether Judah suffered in 605 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Berossus in
Jos. <i>c. Ap.</i> i. 19) or was left unharmed (Jos. <i>Ant.</i> x. 6. 1); perhaps
Nebuchadrezzar made his first inroad against Judah in 602 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
because of its intrigue with Egypt (H. Winckler, <i>Keilinschrift. u. d. alte
Test.</i>, pp. 107 seq.), and the three years of allegiance extends to 599.
The chronicler&rsquo;s tradition (2 Chron. xxxvi. 5-8) speaks of Jehoiakim&rsquo;s
captivity, apparently confusing him with Jehoiachin. The Septuagint,
however, still preserves there the record of his peaceful death,
in agreement with the earlier source in 2 Kings, but against the
prophecy of Jeremiah (xxii. 18 seq., xxxvi. 30), which is accepted by
Jos. <i>Ant.</i> x. 6. 3. The different traditions can scarcely be reconciled.
Nothing certain is known of the marauding bands sent against
Jehoiakim; for Syrians (<i>Aram</i>) one would expect Edomites (<i>Edom</i>),
but see Jer. xxxv. 11; some recensions of the Septuagint even
include the &ldquo;Samaritans&rdquo;! (For further references to this reign

<p><span class="bold">JEHOL<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (&ldquo;hot stream&rdquo;), or <span class="sc">Ch&rsquo;&#275;ng-t&#275;-fu</span>, a city of China,
formerly the seat of the emperor&rsquo;s summer palace, near 118°
E. and 41° N., about 140 m. N.E. of Peking, with which it is
connected by an excellent road. Pop. (estimate), 10,000. It
is a flourishing town, and consists of one great street, about 2 m.
long, with smaller streets radiating in all directions. The people
are well-to-do and there are some fine shops. The palace, called
Pi-shu-shan-chuang, or &ldquo;mountain lodge for avoiding heat,&rdquo;
was built in 1703 on the plan of the palace of Yuen-ming-yuen
near Peking. A substantial brick wall 6 m. in circuit encloses
several well-wooded heights and extensive gardens, rockeries,
pavilions, temples, &amp;c. Jehol was visited by Lord Macartney
on his celebrated mission to the emperor K&rsquo;ienlung in 1793;
and it was to Jehol that the emperor Hienf&#275;ng retired when
the allied armies of England and France occupied Peking in
1860. In the vicinity of Jehol are numerous Lama monasteries
and temples, the most remarkable being Potala-su,
built on the model of the palace of the grand lama of Tibet
at Potala.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEHORAM,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Joram</span> (Heb. &ldquo;Yah[weh] is high&rdquo;), the name
of two Biblical characters.</p>

<p>1. The son of Ahab, and king of Israel in succession to his
brother Ahaziah.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He maintained close relations with Judah,
whose king came to his assistance against Moab which had revolted
after Ahab&rsquo;s death (2 Kings i. 1; iii.). The king in question
is said to have been Jehoshaphat; but, according to Lucian&rsquo;s
recension, it was Ahaziah, whilst i. 17 would show that it was
Jehoram&rsquo;s namesake (see 2). The result of the campaign appears
to have been a defeat for Israel (see on the incidents <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Edom</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Elisha</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Moab</a></span>). The prophetical party were throughout hostile
to Jehoram (with his reform iii. 2 contrast x. 27), and the
singular account of the war of Benhadad king of Syria against
the king of Israel (vi. 24-vii.) shows the feeling against the
reigning dynasty. But whether the incidents in which Elisha
and the unnamed king of Israel appear originally belonged to the
time of Jehoram is very doubtful, and in view of the part which
Elisha took in securing the accession of Jehu, it has been urged
with much force that they belong to the dynasty of the latter,
when the high position of the prophet would be perfectly natural.<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
The briefest account is given of Jehoram&rsquo;s alliance with Ahaziah
(son of 2 below) against Hazael of Syria, at Ramoth-Gilead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
(2 Kings viii. 25-29), and the incident&mdash;with the wounding of
the Israelite king in or about the critical year 842 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;finds a
noteworthy parallel in the time of Jehoshaphat and Ahab
(1 Kings xxii. 29-36) at the period of the equally momentous
events in 854 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ahab</a></span>). See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jehu</a></span>.</p>

<p>2. The son of Jehoshaphat and king of Judah. He married
Athaliah the daughter of Ahab, and thus was brother-in-law of
1. above, and contemporary with him (2 Kings i. 17). In his days
Edom revolted, and this with the mention of Libnah&rsquo;s revolt
(2 Kings viii. 20 sqq.) suggests some common action on the part
of Philistines and Edomites. The chronicler&rsquo;s account of his
life (2 Chron. xxi-xxii. 1) presupposes this, but adds many
remarkable details: he began his reign by massacring his brethren
(cf. Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, and his bloodshed, 2 Kings
ix. seq.); for his wickedness he received a communication from
Elijah foretelling his death from disease (cf. Elijah and Ahaziah
of Israel, 2 Kings i.); in a great invasion of Philistines and Arabian
tribes he lost all his possessions and family, and only Jehoahaz
(<i>i.e.</i> Ahaziah) was saved.<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> His son Ahaziah reigned only for a
year (cf. his namesake of Israel); he is condemned for his
Israelite sympathies, and met his end in the general butchery
which attended the accession of Jehu (2 Kings viii. 25 sqq.;
2 Chron. xxii. 3 seq., 7; with 2 Kings ix. 27 seq., note the variant
tradition in 2 Chron. xxii. 8 seq., and the details which the LXX.
(Lucian) appends to 2 Kings x.).</p>

<p><a name="ft1j" id="ft1j" href="#fa1j"><span class="fn">1</span></a> 2 Kings i. 17 seq.; see Lucian&rsquo;s reading (cf. Vulg. and Pesh.).
Apart from the allusion 1 Kings xxii. 49 (see 2 Chron. xx. 35), and
the narrative in 2 Kings i. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Elijah</a></span>), nothing is known of this
Ahaziah. Notwithstanding his very brief reign (1 Kings xxii. 51;
2 Kings iii. 1), the compiler passes the usual hostile judgment
(1 Kings xxii. 52 seq.); see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kings (Books)</a></span>. The chronology in 1 Kings

<p><span class="bold">JEHOSHAPHAT<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> (Heb. &ldquo;Yahweh judges&rdquo;), in the Bible,
son of Asa, and king of Judah, in the 9th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> During
his period close relations subsisted between Israel and Judah;
the two royal houses were connected by marriage (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Athaliah</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jehoram</a></span>, 2), and undertook joint enterprise in war and commerce.
Jehoshaphat aided Ahab in the battle against Benhadad at
Ramoth-Gilead in which Ahab was slain (1 Kings xxii.; 2 Chron.
xviii.; cf. the parallel incident in 2 Kings viii. 25-29), and trading
journeys to Ophir were undertaken by his fleet in conjunction
no doubt with Ahab as well as with his son Ahaziah (2 Chron.
xx. 35 sqq.; 1 Kings xxii. 47 sqq.). The chronicler&rsquo;s account
of his war against Moab, Ammon and Edomite tribes (2 Chron.
xx.), must rest ultimately upon a tradition which is presupposed
in the earlier source (1 Kings xxii. 47), and the disaster to the
ships at Ezion-Geber at the head of the Gulf of A&#7731;aba preceded,
if it was not the introduction to, the great revolt in the days
of Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s son Jehoram, where, again, the details in
2 Chron. xxi. must rely in the first instance upon an old source.
Apart from what is said of Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s legislative measures
(2 Chron. xix. 4 sqq.; cf. the meaning of his name above), an
account is preserved of his alliance with Jehoram of Israel
against Moab (2 Kings iii.), on which see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jehoram</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Moab</a></span>. The
&ldquo;valley of Jehoshaphat&rdquo; (Joel iii. 12) has been identified by
tradition (as old as Eusebius) with the valley between Jerusalem
and the mount of Olives.</p>

&ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; is a modern mispronunciation of the Hebrew name,
resulting from combining the consonants of that name, <i>Jhvh</i>,
with the vowels of the word <i>&#259;d&#333;n&#257;y</i>, &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; which the Jews
substituted for the proper name in reading the scriptures. In
such cases of substitution the vowels of the word which is to be
read are written in the Hebrew text with the consonants of the
word which is not to be read. The consonants of the word to
be substituted are ordinarily written in the margin; but inasmuch
as Adonay was regularly read instead of the ineffable name Jhvh,
it was deemed unnecessary to note the fact at every occurrence.
When Christian scholars began to study the Old Testament in
Hebrew, if they were ignorant of this general rule or regarded
the substitution as a piece of Jewish superstition, reading what
actually stood in the text, they would inevitably pronounce the
name J&#277;h&#333;v&#257;h. It is an unprofitable inquiry who first made this
blunder; probably many fell into it independently. The statement
still commonly repeated that it originated with Petrus
Galatinus (1518) is erroneous; Jehova occurs in manuscripts
at least as early as the 14th century.</p>

<p>The form Jehovah was used in the 16th century by many
authors, both Catholic and Protestant, and in the 17th was
zealously defended by Fuller, Gataker, Leusden and others,
against the criticisms of such scholars as Drusius, Cappellus and
the elder Buxtorf. It appeared in the English Bible in Tyndale&rsquo;s
translation of the Pentateuch (1530), and is found in all English
Protestant versions of the 16th century except that of Coverdale
(1535). In the Authorized Version of 1611 it occurs in Exod. vi. 3;
Ps. lxxxiii. 18; Isa. xii. 2; xxvi. 4, beside the compound names
Jehovah-jireh, Jehovah-nissi, Jehovah-shalom; elsewhere, in
accordance with the usage of the ancient versions, Jhvh is represented
by Lord (distinguished by capitals from the title &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo;
Heb. <i>adonay</i>). In the Revised Version of 1885 Jehovah is
retained in the places in which it stood in the A. V., and is introduced
also in Exod. vi. 2, 6, 7, 8; Ps. lxviii. 20; Isa. xlix. 14;
Jer. xvi. 21; Hab. iii. 19. The American committee which cooperated
in the revision desired to employ the name Jehovah
wherever Jhvh occurs in the original, and editions embodying
their preferences are printed accordingly.</p>

<p>Several centuries before the Christian era the name Jhvh had
ceased to be commonly used by the Jews. Some of the later
writers in the Old Testament employ the appellative Elohim,
God, prevailingly or exclusively; a collection of Psalms (Ps. xlii.-lxxxiii.)
was revised by an editor who changed the Jhvh of the
authors into Elohim (see <i>e.g.</i> xlv. 7; xlviii. 10; l. 7; li. 14);
observe also the frequency of &ldquo;the Most High,&rdquo; &ldquo;the God of
Heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;King of Heaven,&rdquo; in Daniel, and of &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; in
First Maccabees. The oldest Greek versions (Septuagint), from
the third century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, consistently use <span class="grk" title="Kyrios">&#922;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; where
the Hebrew has Jhvh, corresponding to the substitution of
Adonay for Jhvh in reading the original; in books written in
Greek in this period (<i>e.g.</i> Wisdom, 2 and 3 Maccabees), as in the
New Testament, <span class="grk" title="Kyrios">&#922;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> takes the place of the name of God.
Josephus, who as a priest knew the pronunciation of the name,
declares that religion forbids him to divulge it; Philo calls it
ineffable, and says that it is lawful for those only whose ears and
tongues are purified by wisdom to hear and utter it in a holy
place (that is, for priests in the Temple); and in another passage,
commenting on Lev. xxiv. 15 seq.: &ldquo;If anyone, I do not say
should blaspheme against the Lord of men and gods, but should
even dare to utter his name unseasonably, let him expect the
penalty of death.&rdquo;<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>Various motives may have concurred to bring about the suppression
of the name. An instinctive feeling that a proper name
for God implicitly recognizes the existence of other gods may have
had some influence; reverence and the fear lest the holy name
should be profaned among the heathen were potent reasons; but
probably the most cogent motive was the desire to prevent the
abuse of the name in magic. If so, the secrecy had the opposite
effect; the name of the god of the Jews was one of the great
names in magic, heathen as well as Jewish, and miraculous
efficacy was attributed to the mere utterance of it.</p>

<p>In the liturgy of the Temple the name was pronounced in the
priestly benediction (Num. vi. 27) after the regular daily sacrifice
(in the synagogues a substitute&mdash;probably Adonay&mdash;was employed);<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
on the Day of Atonement the High Priest uttered the
name ten times in his prayers and benediction. In the last
generations before the fall of Jerusalem, however, it was pronounced
in a low tone so that the sounds were lost in the chant
of the priests.<a name="fa4k" id="fa4k" href="#ft4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span></p>

<p>After the destruction of the Temple (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70) the liturgical use
of the name ceased, but the tradition was perpetuated in the
schools of the rabbis.<a name="fa5k" id="fa5k" href="#ft5k"><span class="sp">5</span></a> It was certainly known in Babylonia in
the latter part of the 4th century,<a name="fa6k" id="fa6k" href="#ft6k"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and not improbably much
later. Nor was the knowledge confined to these pious circles;
the name continued to be employed by healers, exorcists and
magicians, and has been preserved in many places in magical
papyri. The vehemence with which the utterance of the name
is denounced in the Mishna&mdash;&ldquo;He who pronounces the Name
with its own letters has no part in the world to come!&rdquo;<a name="fa7k" id="fa7k" href="#ft7k"><span class="sp">7</span></a>&mdash;suggests
that this misuse of the name was not uncommon
among Jews.</p>

<p>The Samaritans, who otherwise shared the scruples of the Jews
about the utterance of the name, seem to have used it in judicial
oaths to the scandal of the rabbis.<a name="fa8k" id="fa8k" href="#ft8k"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>The early Christian scholars, who inquired what was the true
name of the God of the Old Testament, had therefore no great
difficulty in getting the information they sought. Clement of
Alexandria (d. <i>c.</i> 212) says that it was pronounced <span class="grk" title="Iaoue">&#921;&#945;&#959;&#965;&#949;</span>.<a name="fa9k" id="fa9k" href="#ft9k"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
Epiphanius (d. 404), who was born in Palestine and spent a considerable
part of his life there, gives <span class="grk" title="Iabe">&#921;&#945;&#946;&#949;</span> (one cod. <span class="grk" title="Iaue">&#921;&#945;&#965;&#949;</span>).<a name="fa10k" id="fa10k" href="#ft10k"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Theodoret
(d. <i>c.</i> 457),<a name="fa11k" id="fa11k" href="#ft11k"><span class="sp">11</span></a> born in Antioch, writes that the Samaritans
pronounced the name <span class="grk" title="Iabe">&#921;&#945;&#946;&#949;</span> (in another passage, <span class="grk" title="Iabai">&#921;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#953;</span>), the
Jews <span class="grk" title="Aia">&#913;&#7987;&#945;</span>.<a name="fa12k" id="fa12k" href="#ft12k"><span class="sp">12</span></a> The latter is probably not Jhvh but <i>Ehyeh</i> (Exod. iii.
14), which the Jews counted among the names of God; there is
no reason whatever to imagine that the Samaritans pronounced
the name Jhvh differently from the Jews. This direct testimony
is supplemented by that of the magical texts, in which <span class="grk" title="Iabe zebyth">&#921;&#945;&#946;&#949; &#950;&#949;&#946;&#965;&#952;</span>
(Jahveh &#7778;eb&#257;&#333;th), as well as <span class="grk" title="Iaba">&#921;&#945;&#946;&#945;</span>, occurs frequently.<a name="fa13k" id="fa13k" href="#ft13k"><span class="sp">13</span></a> In an
Ethiopic list of magical names of Jesus, purporting to have been
taught by him to his disciples, <i>Y&#257;w&#275;</i> is found.<a name="fa14k" id="fa14k" href="#ft14k"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Finally, there is
evidence from more than one source that the modern Samaritan
priests pronounce the name <i>Yahweh</i> or <i>Yahwa</i>.<a name="fa15k" id="fa15k" href="#ft15k"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>

<p>There is no reason to impugn the soundness of this substantially
consentient testimony to the pronunciation Yahweh or Jahveh,
coming as it does through several independent channels. It is
confirmed by grammatical considerations. The name Jhvh
enters into the composition of many proper names of persons
in the Old Testament, either as the initial element, in the form
Jeho- or Jo- (as in Jehoram, Joram), or as the final element, in
the form <i>-jahu</i> or <i>-jah</i> (as in Adonijahu, Adonijah). These
various forms are perfectly regular if the divine name was
Yahweh, and, taken altogether, they cannot be explained on any
other hypothesis. Recent scholars, accordingly, with but few
exceptions, are agreed that the ancient pronunciation of the
name was Yahweh (the first h sounded at the end of the syllable).</p>

<p>Genebrardus seems to have been the first to suggest the pronunciation
<i>Iahué</i>,<a name="fa16k" id="fa16k" href="#ft16k"><span class="sp">16</span></a> but it was not until the 19th century that it
became generally accepted.</p>

<p>Jahveh or Yahweh is apparently an example of a common
type of Hebrew proper names which have the form of the 3rd
pers. sing, of the verb. <i>e.g.</i> Jabneh (name of a city), J&#257;b&#299;n,
Jaml&#275;k, Jipt&#257;&#7717; (Jephthah), &amp;c. Most of these really are verbs,
the suppressed or implicit subject being &rsquo;<i>&#275;l</i>, &ldquo;<i>numen</i>, god,&rdquo; or
the name of a god; cf. Jabneh and Jabn&#277;-&#275;l, Jipt&#257;&#7717; and Jipta&#7717;-&#275;l.</p>

<p>The ancient explanations of the name proceed from Exod. iii.
14, 15, where &ldquo;Yahweh<a name="fa17k" id="fa17k" href="#ft17k"><span class="sp">17</span></a> hath sent me&rdquo; in <i>v.</i> 15 corresponds
to &ldquo;Ehyeh hath sent me&rdquo; in <i>v.</i> 14, thus seeming to connect
the name Yahweh with the Hebrew verb <i>h&#257;y&#257;h</i>, &ldquo;to become, to
be.&rdquo; The Palestinian interpreters found in this the promise that
God would be with his people (cf. <i>v.</i> 12) in future oppressions as
he was in the present distress, or the assertion of his eternity, or
eternal constancy; the Alexandrian translation <span class="grk" title="Egô eimi ho ôn
... Ho ôn apestalken me pros hymas">&#7960;&#947;&#974; &#949;&#7984;&#956;&#953; &#8001; &#8036;&#957; ...
&#8009; &#8034;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#954;&#941;&#957; &#956;&#949; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span>, understands it in the
more metaphysical sense of God&rsquo;s absolute being. Both interpretations,
&ldquo;He (who) is (always the same),&rdquo; and &ldquo;He (who) is
(absolutely, the truly existent),&rdquo; import into the name all that
they profess to find in it; the one, the religious faith in God&rsquo;s
unchanging fidelity to his people, the other, a philosophical conception
of absolute being which is foreign both to the meaning of
the Hebrew verb and to the force of the tense employed. Modern
scholars have sometimes found in the name the expression of
the aseity<a name="fa18k" id="fa18k" href="#ft18k"><span class="sp">18</span></a> of God; sometimes of his reality, in contrast to the
imaginary gods of the heathen. Another explanation, which
appears first in Jewish authors of the middle ages and has found
wide acceptance in recent times, derives the name from the
causative of the verb; He (who) causes things to be, gives them
being; or calls events into existence, brings them to pass; with
many individual modifications of interpretation&mdash;creator, life-giver,
fulfiller of promises. A serious objection to this theory
in every form is that the verb <i>h&#257;y&#257;h</i>, &ldquo;to be,&rdquo; has no causative
stem in Hebrew; to express the ideas which these scholars find
in the name Yahweh the language employs altogether different
verbs.</p>

<p>This assumption that Yahweh is derived from the verb &ldquo;to be,&rdquo;
as seems to be implied in Exod. iii. 14 seq., is not, however, free
from difficulty. &ldquo;To be&rdquo; in the Hebrew of the Old Testament
is not <i>h&#257;w&#257;h</i>, as the derivation would require, but <i>h&#257;y&#257;h</i>; and we
are thus driven to the further assumption that <i>h&#257;w&#257;h</i> belongs to
an earlier stage of the language, or to some older speech of the
forefathers of the Israelites. This hypothesis is not intrinsically
improbable&mdash;and in Aramaic, a language closely related to
Hebrew, &ldquo;to be&rdquo; actually is <i>h&#257;w&#257;</i>&mdash;but it should be noted that
in adopting it we admit that, using the name Hebrew in the historical
sense, Yahweh is not a Hebrew name. And, inasmuch as
nowhere in the Old Testament, outside of Exod. iii., is there the
slightest indication that the Israelites connected the name of
their God with the idea of &ldquo;being&rdquo; in any sense, it may fairly
be questioned whether, if the author of Exod. iii. 14 seq., intended
to give an etymological interpretation of the name Yahweh,<a name="fa19k" id="fa19k" href="#ft19k"><span class="sp">19</span></a> his
etymology is any better than many other paronomastic explanations
of proper names in the Old Testament, or than, say, the
connexion of the name <span class="grk" title="Apollôn">&#7944;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#955;&#969;&#957;</span> with <span class="grk" title="apolouôn">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#969;&#957;</span>, <span class="grk" title="apolyôn">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#969;&#957;</span> in
Plato&rsquo;s <i>Cratylus</i>, or the popular derivation from <span class="grk" title="apollymi">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#953;</span>.</p>

<p>A root <i>h&#257;w&#257;h</i> is represented in Hebrew by the nouns <i>h&#333;w&#257;h</i>
(Ezek., Isa. xlvii. 11) and <i>haww&#257;h</i> (Ps., Prov., Job) &ldquo;disaster,
calamity, ruin.&rdquo;<a name="fa20k" id="fa20k" href="#ft20k"><span class="sp">20</span></a> The primary meaning is probably &ldquo;sink
down, fall,&rdquo; in which sense&mdash;common in Arabic&mdash;the verb
appears in Job xxxvii. 6 (of snow falling to earth). A Catholic
commentator of the 16th century, Hieronymus ab Oleastro,
seems to have been the first to connect the name &ldquo;Jehova&rdquo;
with <i>h&#333;w&#257;h</i> interpreting it <i>contritio, sive pernicies</i> (destruction
of the Egyptians and Canaanites); Daumer, adopting the same
etymology, took it in a more general sense: Yahweh, as well as
Shaddai, meant &ldquo;Destroyer,&rdquo; and fitly expressed the nature
of the terrible god whom he identified with Moloch.</p>

<p>The derivation of Yahweh from <i>h&#257;w&#257;h</i> is formally unimpeachable,
and is adopted by many recent scholars, who proceed,
however, from the primary sense of the root rather than from the
specific meaning of the nouns. The name is accordingly interpreted,
He (who) falls (baetyl, <span class="grk" title="baitylos">&#946;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, meteorite); or causes
(rain or lightning) to fall (storm god); or casts down (his foes,
by his thunderbolts). It is obvious that if the derivation be
correct, the significance of the name, which in itself denotes
only &ldquo;He falls&rdquo; or &ldquo;He fells,&rdquo; must be learned, if at all, from
early Israelitish conceptions of the nature of Yahweh rather than
from etymology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span></p>

<p>A more fundamental question is whether the name Yahweh
originated among the Israelites or was adopted by them from
some other people and speech.<a name="fa21k" id="fa21k" href="#ft21k"><span class="sp">21</span></a> The biblical author of the history
of the sacred institutions (P) expressly declares that the
name Yahweh was unknown to the patriarchs (Exod. vi. 3), and
the much older Israelite historian (E) records the first revelation
of the name to Moses (Exod. iii. 13-15), apparently following a
tradition according to which the Israelites had not been worshippers
of Yahweh before the time of Moses, or, as he conceived
it, had not worshipped the god of their fathers under that name.
The revelation of the name to Moses was made at a mountain
sacred to Yahweh (the mountain of God) far to the south of
Palestine, in a region where the forefathers of the Israelites had
never roamed, and in the territory of other tribes; and long after
the settlement in Canaan this region continued to be regarded as
the abode of Yahweh (Judg. v. 4; Deut. xxxiii. 2 sqq.; 1 Kings xix.
8 sqq. &amp;c.). Moses is closely connected with the tribes in the vicinity
of the holy mountain; according to one account, he married a
daughter of the priest of Midian (Exod. ii. 16 sqq.; iii. 1); to this
mountain he led the Israelites after their deliverance from
Egypt; there his father-in-law met him, and extolling Yahweh
as &ldquo;greater than all the gods,&rdquo; offered (in his capacity as priest
of the place?) sacrifices, at which the chief men of the Israelites
were his guests; there the religion of Yahweh was revealed
through Moses, and the Israelites pledged themselves to serve
God according to its prescriptions. It appears, therefore, that
in the tradition followed by the Israelite historian the tribes
within whose pasture lands the mountain of God stood were
worshippers of Yahweh before the time of Moses; and the surmise
that the name Yahweh belongs to their speech, rather than to
that of Israel, has considerable probability. One of these tribes
was Midian, in whose land the mountain of God lay. The
Kenites also, with whom another tradition connects Moses,
seem to have been worshippers of Yahweh. It is probable that
Yahweh was at one time worshipped by various tribes south of
Palestine, and that several places in that wide territory (Horeb,
Sinai, Kadesh, &amp;c.) were sacred to him; the oldest and most
famous of these, the mountain of God, seems to have lain in
Arabia, east of the Red Sea. From some of these peoples and
at one of these holy places, a group of Israelite tribes adopted the
religion of Yahweh, the God who, by the hand of Moses, had
delivered them from Egypt.<a name="fa22k" id="fa22k" href="#ft22k"><span class="sp">22</span></a></p>

<p>The tribes of this region probably belonged to some branch of
the great Arab stock, and the name Yahweh has, accordingly,
been connected with the Arabic <i>haw&#257;</i>, &ldquo;the void&rdquo; (between
heaven and earth), &ldquo;the atmosphere,&rdquo; or with the verb <i>haw&#257;</i>,
cognate with Heb. <i>h&#257;w&#257;h</i>, &ldquo;sink, glide down&rdquo; (through space);
<i>haww&#257;</i> &ldquo;blow&rdquo; (wind). &ldquo;He rides through the air, He blows&rdquo;
(Wellhausen), would be a fit name for a god of wind and storm.
There is, however, no certain evidence that the Israelites in historical
times had any consciousness of the primitive significance
of the name.</p>

<p>The attempts to connect the name Yahweh with that of
an Indo-European deity (Jehovah-Jove, &amp;c.), or to derive it from
Egyptian or Chinese, may be passed over. But one theory which
has had considerable currency requires notice, namely, that
Yahweh, or Yahu, Yaho,<a name="fa23k" id="fa23k" href="#ft23k"><span class="sp">23</span></a> is the name of a god worshipped
throughout the whole, or a great part, of the area occupied by
the Western Semites. In its earlier form this opinion rested
chiefly on certain misinterpreted testimonies in Greek authors
about a god <span class="grk" title="Iaô">&#7992;&#940;&#969;</span>, and was conclusively refuted by Baudissin; recent
adherents of the theory build more largely on the occurrence
in various parts of this territory of proper names of persons
and places which they explain as compounds of Yahu or Yah.<a name="fa24k" id="fa24k" href="#ft24k"><span class="sp">24</span></a>
The explanation is in most cases simply an assumption of the
point at issue; some of the names have been misread; others
are undoubtedly the names of Jews. There remain, however,
some cases in which it is highly probable that names of non-Israelites
are really compounded with Yahweh. The most
conspicuous of these is the king of Hamath who in the inscriptions
of Sargon (722-705 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) is called Yaubi&rsquo;di and Ilubi&rsquo;di
(compare Jehoiakim-Eliakim). Azriyau of Jaudi, also, in
inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser (745-728 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), who was formerly
supposed to be Azariah (Uzziah) of Judah, is probably
a king of the country in northern Syria known to us from the
Zenjirli inscriptions as Ja&rsquo;di.</p>

<p>Friedrich Delitzsch brought into notice three tablets, of the
age of the first dynasty of Babylon, in which he read the names
of <i>Ya-a&rsquo;-ve-ilu</i>, <i>Ya-ve-ilu</i>, and <i>Ya-&#363;-um-ilu</i> (&ldquo;Yahweh is God&rdquo;),
and which he regarded as conclusive proof that Yahweh was
known in Babylonia before 2000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; he was a god of the
Semitic invaders in the second wave of migration, who were,
according to Winckler and Delitzsch, of North Semitic stock
(Canaanites, in the linguistic sense).<a name="fa25k" id="fa25k" href="#ft25k"><span class="sp">25</span></a> We should thus have
in the tablets evidence of the worship of Yahweh among the
Western Semites at a time long before the rise of Israel. The
reading of the names is, however, extremely uncertain, not to say
improbable, and the far-reaching inferences drawn from them
carry no conviction. In a tablet attributed to the 14th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> which Sellin found in the course of his excavations at
Tell Ta&rsquo;annuk (the Taanach of the O.T.) a name occurs which
may be read Ahi-Yawi (equivalent to Hebrew Ahijah);<a name="fa26k" id="fa26k" href="#ft26k"><span class="sp">26</span></a> if the
reading be correct, this would show that Yahweh was worshipped
in Central Palestine before the Israelite conquest.
The reading is, however, only one of several possibilities. The
fact that the full form Yahweh appears, whereas in Hebrew
proper names only the shorter Yahu and Yah occur, weighs
somewhat against the interpretation, as it does against Delitzsch&rsquo;s
reading of his tablets.</p>

<p>It would not be at all surprising if, in the great movements
of populations and shifting of ascendancy which lie beyond
our historical horizon, the worship of Yahweh should have been
established in regions remote from those which it occupied in
historical times; but nothing which we now know warrants the
opinion that his worship was ever general among the Western
Semites.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to trace the West Semitic
Yahu back to Babylonia. Thus Delitzsch formerly derived the
name from an Akkadian god, I or Ia; or from the Semitic
nominative ending, Yau;<a name="fa27k" id="fa27k" href="#ft27k"><span class="sp">27</span></a> but this deity has since disappeared
from the pantheon of Assyriologists. The combination of
Yah with Ea, one of the great Babylonian gods, seems to have a
peculiar fascination for amateurs, by whom it is periodically
&ldquo;discovered.&rdquo; Scholars are now agreed that, so far as Yahu or
Yah occurs in Babylonian texts, it is as the name of a foreign
god.</p>

<p>Assuming that Yahweh was primitively a nature god, scholars
in the 19th century discussed the question over what sphere of
nature he originally presided. According to some he was the
god of consuming fire; others saw in him the bright sky, or the
heaven; still others recognized in him a storm god, a theory
with which the derivation of the name from Heb. <i>h&#257;w&#257;h</i> or Arab.
<i>haw&#257;</i> well accords. The association of Yahweh with storm and
fire is frequent in the Old Testament; the thunder is the voice
of Yahweh, the lightning his arrows, the rainbow his bow. The
revelation at Sinai is amid the awe-inspiring phenomena of
tempest. Yahweh leads Israel through the desert in a pillar of
cloud and fire; he kindles Elijah&rsquo;s altar by lightning, and
translates the prophet in a chariot of fire. See also Judg. v. 4 seq.;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
Deut. xxxiii. 1; Ps. xviii. 7-15; Hab. iii. 3-6. The cherub
upon which he rides when he flies on the wings of the wind
(Ps. xviii. 10) is not improbably an ancient mythological personification
of the storm cloud, the genius of tempest (cf. Ps.
civ. 3). In Ezekiel the throne of Yahweh is borne up on Cherubim,
the noise of whose wings is like thunder. Though we may
recognize in this poetical imagery the survival of ancient and,
if we please, mythical notions, we should err if we inferred
that Yahweh was originally a departmental god, presiding
specifically over meteorological phenomena, and that this conception
of him persisted among the Israelites till very late times.
Rather, as the god&mdash;or the chief god&mdash;of a region and a people,
the most sublime and impressive phenomena, the control of the
mightiest forces of nature are attributed to him. As the God
of Israel Yahweh becomes its leader and champion in war; he
is a warrior, mighty in battle; but he is not a god of war in the
specific sense.</p>

<p>In the inquiry concerning the nature of Yahweh the name
Yahweh Sebaoth (E.V., The <span class="sc">Lord</span> of Hosts) has had an important
place. The hosts have by some been interpreted of the armies
of Israel (see 1 Sam. xvii. 45, and note the association of the name
in the Books of Samuel, where it first appears, with the ark, or
with war); by others, of the heavenly hosts, the stars conceived
as living beings, later, perhaps, the angels as the court of Yahweh
and the instruments of his will in nature and history (Ps. lxxxix.);
or of the forces of the world in general which do his bidding,
cf. the common Greek renderings, <span class="grk" title="Kyrios tôn dynameôn">&#922;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#948;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#969;&#957;</span> and
<span class="grk" title="K. pantokratôr">&#922;. &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</span>, (Universal Ruler). It is likely that the name
was differently understood in different periods and circles; but
in the prophets the hosts are clearly superhuman powers. In
many passages the name seems to be only a more solemn substitute
for the simple Yahweh, and as such it has probably
often been inserted by scribes. Finally, Sebaoth came to be
treated as a proper name (cf. Ps. lxxx. 5, 8, 20), and as such is
very common in magical texts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEHU,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi, in the
Bible, a general of Ahab and Jehoram, and, later, king of Israel.
Ahaziah son of Jehoram of Judah and Jehoram brother of Ahaziah
of Israel had taken joint action against the Aramaeans of Damascus
who were attacking Ramoth-Gilead under Hazael. Jehoram
had returned wounded to his palace at Jezreel, whither Ahaziah
had come down to visit him. Jehu, meanwhile, remained at the
seat of war, and the prophet Elisha sent a messenger to anoint
him king. The general at once acknowledged the call, &ldquo;drove
furiously&rdquo; to Jezreel, and, having slain both kings, proceeded
to exterminate the whole of the royal family (2 Kings ix., x.). A
similar fate befell the royal princes of Judah (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Athaliah</a></span>),
and thus, for a time at least, the new king must have had complete
control over the two kingdoms (cf. 2 Chron. xxii. 9).
Israelite historians viewed these events as a great religious
revolution inspired by Elijah and initiated by Elisha, as the
overthrow of the worship of Baal, and as a retribution for the
cruel murder of Naboth the Jezreelite (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jezebel</a></span>). A vivid
description is given of the destruction of the prophets of Baal at
the temple in Samaria (2 Kings x. 27; contrast iii. 2). While Jehu
was supported by the Rechabites in his reforming zeal, a similar
revolt against Baalism in Judah is ascribed to the priest Jehoiada
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Joash</a></span>). In the tragedies of the period it seems clear that
Elisha&rsquo;s interest in both Jehu and the Syrian Hazael (2 Kings
viii. 7 sqq.) had some political significance, and in opposition
to the &ldquo;Deuteronomic&rdquo; the commendation in 2 Kings x. 28
sqq., Hosea&rsquo;s denunciation (i. 4) indicates the judgment which
was passed upon Jehu&rsquo;s bloodshed in other circles.</p>

<p>In the course of an expedition against Hazael in 842 Shalmaneser
II. of Assyria received tribute of silver and gold from
Ya-u-a son of Omri,<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Tyre and Sidon; another attack followed
in 839. For some years after this Assyria was unable to interfere,
and war broke out between Damascus and Israel. The Israelite
story, which may perhaps be supplemented from Judaean sources
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Joash</a></span>), records a great loss of territory on the east of the
Jordan (2 Kings x. 32 seq.). Under Jehu&rsquo;s successor Jehoahaz
there was continual war with Hazael and his son Benhadad,
but relief was obtained by his grandson Joash, and the land
recovered complete independence under Jeroboam.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEKYLL, SIR JOSEPH<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1663-1738), English lawyer and master
of the rolls, son of John Jekyll, was born in London, and after
studying at the Middle Temple was called to the bar in 1687.
He rapidly rose to be chief justice of Chester (1697), serjeant-at-law
and king&rsquo;s serjeant (1700), and a knight. In 1717 he was
made master of the rolls. A Whig in politics, he sat in parliament
for various constituencies from 1697 to the end of his life, and
took an active part there in debating constitutional questions
with much learning, though, according to Lord Hervey (<i>Mem.</i> 1,
474), with little &ldquo;approbation.&rdquo; He was censured by the House
of Commons for accepting a brief for the defence of Lord Halifax
in a prosecution ordered by the house. He was one of the
managers of the impeachment of the Jacobite earl of Wintoun
in 1715, and of Harley (Lord Oxford) in 1717. In later years
he supported Walpole. He became very unpopular in 1736 for
his introduction of the &ldquo;gin act,&rdquo; taxing the retailing of
spirituous liquors, and his house had to be protected from the
mob. Pope has an illusion to &ldquo;Jekyll or some odd Whig, Who
never changed his principle or wig&rdquo; (<i>Epilogue to the Satires</i>).
Jekyll was also responsible for the Mortmain Act of 1736, which
was not superseded till 1888. He died without issue in 1738.</p>

<p>His great-nephew <span class="sc">Joseph Jekyll</span> (d. 1837) was a lawyer,
politician and wit, who excited a good deal of contemporary
satire, and who wrote some <i>jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i> which were well-known
in his time. His <i>Letters of the late Ignatius Sancho, an African</i>,
was published in 1782. In 1894 his correspondence was edited,
with a memoir, by the Hon. Algernon Bourke.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JELLACHICH, JOSEF,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1801-1859), Croatian statesman,
was born on the 16th of October 1801 at Pétervárad. He
entered the Austrian army (1819), fought against the Bosnians
in 1845, was made ban of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia in
1848 on the petition of the Croatians, and was simultaneously
raised to the rank of lieutenant-general by the emperor. As ban,
Jellachich&rsquo;s policy was directed to preserving the Slav kingdoms
for the Habsburg monarchy by identifying himself with the
nationalist opposition to Magyar ascendancy, while at the same
time discouraging the extreme &ldquo;Illyrism&rdquo; advocated by Lodovik
Gáj (1809-1872). Though his separatist measures at first
brought him into disfavour at the imperial court, their true
objective was soon recognized, and, with the triumph of the more
violent elements of the Hungarian revolution, he was hailed as
the most conspicuous champion of the unity of the empire, and
was able to bring about that union of the imperial army with the
southern Slavs by which the revolution in Vienna and Budapest
was overthrown (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Austria-Hungary</a></span>: <i>History</i>). He began
the war of independence in September 1848 by crossing the Drave
at the head of 40,000 Croats. After the bloody battle of Buda
he concluded a three days&rsquo; truce with the Hungarians to enable
him to assist Prince Windischgrätz to reduce Vienna, and subsequently
fought against the Magyars at Schwechát. During the
winter campaign of 1848-49 he commanded, under Windischgrätz,
the Austrian right wing, capturing Magyar-Ovar and
Raab, and defeating the Magyars at Mór. After the recapture
of Buda he was made commander-in-chief of the southern army.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
At first he gained some successes against Bem (<i>q.v.</i>), but on the
14th of July 1849 was routed by the Hungarians at Hegyes and
driven behind the Danube. He took no part in the remainder
of the war, but returned to Agram to administer Croatia. In
1853 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the army sent
against Montenegro, and in 1855 was created a count. He died
on the 20th of May 1859. His <i>Gedichte</i> were published at Vienna
in 1851.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JELLINEK, ADOLF<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (1821-1893), Jewish preacher and
scholar, was born in Moravia. After filling clerical posts in
Leipzig, he became <i>Prediger</i> (preacher) in Vienna in 1856.
He was associated with the promoters of the New Learning
within Judaism, and wrote on the history of the Kabbala. His
bibliographies (each bearing the Hebrew title <i>Qontres</i>) were useful
compilations. But his most important work lay in three other
directions. (1) <i>Midrashic.</i> Jellinek published in the six parts
of his <i>Beth ha-Midrasch</i> (1853-1878) a large number of smaller
<i>Midrashi</i>, ancient and medieval homilies and folk-lore records,
which have been of much service in the recent revival of interest
in Jewish apocalyptic literature. A translation of these collections
of Jellinek into German was undertaken by A. Wuensche,
under the general title <i>Aus Israels Lehrhalle</i>. (2) <i>Psychological.</i>
Before the study of ethnic psychology had become a science,
Jellinek devoted attention to the subject. There is much keen
analysis and original investigation in his two essays <i>Der jüdische
Stamm</i> (1869) and <i>Der jüdische Stamm in nicht-jüdischen
Sprüch-wörtern</i> (1881-1882). It is to Jellinek that we owe
the oft-repeated comparison of the Jewish temperament to
that of women in its quickness of perception, versatility and
sensibility. (3) <i>Homiletic.</i> Jellinek was probably the greatest
synagogue orator of the 19th century. He published some 200
sermons, in most of which are displayed unobtrusive learning,
fresh application of old sayings, and a high conception of
Judaism and its claims. Jellinek was a powerful apologist and
an accomplished homilist, at once profound and ingenious.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">George Jellinek</span>, was appointed professor of international
law at Heidelberg in 1891. Another son, <span class="sc">Max Hermann
Jellinek</span>, was made assistant professor of philology at Vienna
in 1892.</p>

<p>A brother of Adolf, <span class="sc">Hermann Jellinek</span> (b. 1823), was
executed at the age of 26 on account of his association with
the Hungarian national movement of 1848. One of Hermann
Jellinek&rsquo;s best-known works was <i>Uriel Acosta</i>. Another brother,
<span class="sc">Moritz Jellinek</span> (1823-1883), was an accomplished economist,
and contributed to the Academy of Sciences essays on
the price of cereals and on the statistical organization of the
country. He founded the Budapest tramway company (1864)
and was also president of the corn exchange.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JENA,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> a university town of Germany, in the grand duchy of
Saxe-Weimar, on the left bank of the Saale, 56 m. S.W. from
Leipzig by the Grossberigen-Saalfeld and 12 m. S.E. of Weimar
by the Weimar-Gera lines of railway. Pop. (1905), 26,355.
Its situation in a broad valley environed by limestone hills is
somewhat dreary. To the north lies the plateau, descending
steeply to the valley, famous as the scene of the battle of Jena.
The town is surrounded by promenades occupying the site of
the old fortifications; it contains in addition to the medieval
market square, many old-fashioned houses and quaint narrow
streets. Besides the old university buildings, the most interesting
edifices are the 15th-century church of St Michael, with a
tower 318 ft. high, containing an altar, beneath which is a doorway
leading to a vault, and a bronze statue of Luther, originally
destined for his tomb; the university library, in which is preserved
a curious figure of a dragon; and the bridge across the Saale, as
long as the church steeple is high, the centre arch of which is
surmounted by a stone carved head of a malefactor. Across
the river is the &ldquo;mountain,&rdquo; or hill, whence a fine view is obtained
of the town and surroundings, and hard by the Fuchs-Turm
(Fox tower) celebrated for student orgies, while in the
centre of the town is the house of an astronomer, Weigel, with
a deep shaft through which the stars can be seen in the day time.
Thus the seven marvels of Jena are summed up in the Latin
lines:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p><i>Ara, caput, draco, mons, pons, vulpecula turris,</i></p>
<p><i>Weigeliana domus; septem miracula Jenae.</i></p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">There must also be mentioned the university church, the new
university buildings, which occupy the site of the ducal palace
(Schloss) where Goethe wrote his <i>Hermann und Dorothea</i>, the
Schwarzer Bär Hotel, where Luther spent the night after his
flight from the Wartburg, and four towers and a gateway which
now alone mark the position of the ancient walls. The town has
of late years become a favourite residential resort and has greatly
extended towards the west, where there is a colony of pleasant
villas. Its chief prosperity centres, however, in the university.
In 1547 the elector John Frederick the Magnanimous of Saxony,
while a captive in the hands of the emperor Charles V., conceived
the plan of founding a university at Jena, which was accordingly
established by his three sons. After having obtained a charter
from the emperor Ferdinand I., it was inaugurated on the 2nd
of February 1558. It was most numerously attended about the
middle of the 18th century; but the most brilliant professoriate
was under the duke Charles Augustus, Goethe&rsquo;s patron (1787-1806),
when Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, Schlegel and Schiller were
on its teaching staff. Founded as a home for the new religious
opinions of the 16th century, it has ever been in the forefront
of German universities in liberally accepting new ideas. It
distances perhaps every other German university in the extent
to which it carries out what are popularly regarded as the characteristics
of German student-life&mdash;duelling and the passion for
<i>Freiheit</i>. At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th
century, the opening of new universities, co-operating with the
suspicions of the various German governments as to the democratic
opinions which obtained at Jena, militated against the
university, which has never regained its former prosperity. In
1905 it was attended by about 1100 students, and its teaching
staff (including <i>privatdocenten</i>) numbered 112. Amongst its
numerous auxiliaries may be mentioned the library, with 200,000
volumes, the observatory, the meteorological institute, the botanical
garden, seminaries of theology, philology and education,
and well equipped clinical, anatomical and physical institutes.
There are also veterinary and agricultural colleges in connexion
with the university. The manufactures of Jena are not considerable.

<p>Jena appears to have possessed municipal rights in the 13th
century. At the beginning of the 14th century it was in the
possession of the margraves of Meissen, from whom it passed in
1423 to the elector of Saxony. Since 1485 it has remained in
the Ernestine line of the house of Saxony. In 1662 it fell to
Bernhard, youngest son of William duke of Weimar, and became
the capital of a small separate duchy. Bernhard&rsquo;s line having
become extinct in 1690, Jena was united with Eisenach, and in
1741 reverted with that duchy to Weimar. In more modern
times Jena has been made famous by the defeat inflicted in
the vicinity, on the 14th of October 1806, by Napoleon upon the
Prussian army under the prince of Hohenlohe (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleonic
Campaigns</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JENATSCH, GEORG<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1596-1639), Swiss political leader, one
of the most striking figures in the troubled history of the Grisons
in the 17th century, was born at Samaden (capital of the Upper
Engadine). He studied at Zürich and Basel, and in 1617 became
the Protestant pastor of Scharans (near Thusis). But almost at
once he plunged into active politics, taking the side of the
Venetian and Protestant party of the Salis family, as against
the Spanish and Romanist policy supported by the rival family,
that of Planta. He headed the &ldquo;preachers&rdquo; who in 1618 tortured
to death the arch-priest Rusca, of Sondrio, and outlawed
the Plantas. As reprisals, a number of Protestants were
massacred at Tirano (1620), in the Valtellina, a very fertile
valley, of considerable strategical importance (for through it
the Spaniards in Milan could communicate by the Umbrail Pass
with the Austrians in Tirol), which then fell into the hands of the
Spanish. Jenatsch took part in the murder (1621) of Pompey
Planta, the head of the rival party, but later with his friends was
compelled to fly the country, giving up his position as a pastor,
and henceforth acting solely as a soldier. He helped in the revolt
against the Austrians in the Prättigau (1622), and in the invasion
of the Valtellina by a French army (1624), but the peace made
(1626) between France and Spain left the Valtellina in the
hands of the pope, and so destroyed Jenatsch&rsquo;s hopes. Having
killed his colonel, Ruinelli, in a duel, Jenatsch had once more to
leave his native land, and took service with the Venetians
(1629-1630). In 1631 he went to Paris, and actively supported
Richelieu&rsquo;s schemes for driving the Spaniards out of the Valtellina,
which led to the successful campaign of Rohan (1635),
one of whose firmest supporters was Jenatsch. But he soon saw
that the French were as unwilling as the Spaniards to restore
the Valtellina to the Grisons (which had seized it in 1512). So
he became a Romanist (1635), and negotiated secretly with the
Spaniards and Austrians. He was the leader of the conspiracy
which broke out in 1637, and resulted in the expulsion of Rohan
and the French from the Grisons. This treachery on Jenatsch&rsquo;s
part did not, however, lead to the freeing of the Valtellina from
the Spaniards, and once more he tried to get French support. But
on the 24th of January 1639 he was assassinated at Coire by
the Plantas; later in the same year the much coveted valley
was restored by Spain to the Grisons, which held it till 1797.
Jenatsch&rsquo;s career is of general historical importance by reason of
the long conflict between France and Spain for the possession
of the Valtellina, which forms one of the most bloody episodes
in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JENGHIZ KHAN<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1162-1227), Mongol emperor, was born in a
tent on the banks of the river Onon. His father Yesukai was
absent at the time of his birth, in a campaign against a Tatar
chieftain named Temuchin. The fortune of war favoured
Yesukai, who having slain his enemy returned to his encampment
in triumph. Here he was met by the news that his wife Yulun
had given birth to a son. On examining the child <span class="correction" title="amended from be">he</span> observed
in its clenched fist a clot of coagulated blood like a red stone.
In the eyes of the superstitious Mongol this circumstance referred
to his victory over the Tatar chieftain, and he therefore named
the infant Temuchin. The death of Yesukai, which placed
Temuchin at the age of thirteen on the Mongol throne, was the
signal also for the dispersal of several tribes whose allegiance
the old chieftain had retained by his iron rule. When remonstrated
with by Temuchin, the rebels replied: &ldquo;The deepest
wells are sometimes dry, and the hardest stone is sometimes
broken; why should we cling to thee?&rdquo; But Yulun was by no
means willing to see her son&rsquo;s power melt away; she led those
retainers who remained faithful against the deserters, and succeeded
in bringing back fully one half to their allegiance. With
this doubtful material, Temuchin succeeded in holding his
ground against the plots and open hostilities of the neighbouring
tribes, more especially of the Naimans, Keraits and Merkits.
With one or other of these he maintained an almost unceasing
warfare until 1206, when he felt strong enough to proclaim himself
the ruler of an empire. He therefore summoned the notables
of his kingdom to an assembly on the banks of the Onon, and
at their unanimous request adopted the name and title of
Jenghiz Khan (Chinese, Chêng-sze, or &ldquo;perfect warrior&rdquo;). At
this time there remained to him but one open enemy on the
Mongolian steppes, Polo the Naiman khan. Against this chief
he now led his troops, and in one battle so completely shattered
his forces that Kushlek, the successor of Polo, who was left dead
upon the field, fled with his ally Toto, the Merkit khan, to the
river Irtysh.</p>

<p>Jenghiz Khan now meditated an invasion of the empire of the
Kin Tatars, who had wrested northern China from the Sung
dynasty. As a first step he invaded western Hia, and, having
captured several strongholds, retired in the summer of 1208 to
Lung-ting to escape the great heat of the plains. While there
news reached him that Toto and Kushlek were preparing for
war. In a pitched battle on the river Irtysh he overthrew them
completely. Toto was amongst the slain, and Kushlek fled for
refuge to the Khitan Tatars. Satisfied with his victory, Jenghiz
again directed his forces against Hia. After having defeated
the Kin army under the leadership of a son of the sovereign, he
captured the Wu-liang-hai Pass in the Great Wall, and penetrated
as far as Ning-sia Fu in Kansuh. With unceasing vigour
he pushed on his troops, and even established his sway over the
province of Liaotung. Several of the Kin commanders, seeing
how persistently victory attended his banners, deserted to him,
and garrisons surrendered at his bidding. Having thus secured
a firm footing within the Great Wall, he despatched three armies
in the autumn of 1213 to overrun the empire. The right wing,
under his three sons, Juji, Jagatai and Ogotai, marched towards
the south; the left wing, under his brothers Hochar, Kwang-tsin
Noyen and Chow-tse-te-po-shi, advanced eastward towards the
sea; while Jenghiz and his son Tul&#275; with the centre directed their
course in a south-easterly direction. Complete success attended
all three expeditions. The right wing advanced as far as Honan,
and after having captured upwards of twenty-eight cities rejoined
headquarters by the great western road. Hochar made himself
master of the country as far as Liao-si; and Jenghiz ceased his
triumphal career only when he reached the cliffs of the Shantung
promontory. But either because he was weary of the
strife, or because it was necessary to revisit his Mongolian
empire, he sent an envoy to the Kin emperor in the spring of the
following year (1214), saying, &ldquo;All your possessions in Shantung
and the whole country north of the Yellow River are now
mine with the solitary exception of Yenking (the modern Peking).
By the decree of heaven you are now as weak as I am strong, but
I am willing to retire from my conquests; as a condition of my
doing so, however, it will be necessary that you distribute
largess to my officers and men to appease their fierce hostility.&rdquo;
These terms of safety the Kin emperor eagerly accepted, and as
a peace offering he presented Jenghiz with a daughter of the late
emperor, another princess of the imperial house, 500 youths and
maidens, and 3000 horses. No sooner, however, had Jenghiz
passed beyond the Great Wall than the Kin emperor, fearing to
remain any longer so near the Mongol frontier, moved his court
to K&rsquo;ai-fêng Fu in Honan. This transfer of capital appearing
to Jenghiz to indicate a hostile attitude, he once more marched
his troops into the doomed empire.</p>

<p>While Jenghiz was thus adding city to city and province to
province in China, Kushlek, the fugitive Naiman chief, was not
idle. With characteristic treachery he requested permission
from his host, the Khitan khan, to collect the fragments of his
army which had been scattered by Jenghiz at the battle on the
Irtysh, and thus having collected a considerable force he leagued
himself with Mahommed, the shah of Khw&#257;rizm, against the
confiding khan. After a short but decisive campaign the allies
remained masters of the position, and the khan was compelled
to abdicate the throne in favour of the late guest.</p>

<p>With the power and prestige thus acquired, Kushlek prepared
once again to measure swords with the Mongol chief. On
receiving the news of his hostile preparations, Jenghiz at once
took the field, and in the first battle routed the Naiman troops
and made Kushlek a prisoner. His ill-gotten kingdom became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span>
an apanage of the Mongol Empire. Jenghiz now held sway up
to the Khw&#257;rizm frontier. Beyond this he had no immediate
desire to go, and he therefore sent envoys to Mahommed, the
shah, with presents, saying, &ldquo;I send thee greeting; I know thy
power and the vast extent of thine empire; I regard thee as my
most cherished son. On my part thou must know that I have
conquered China and all the Turkish nations north of it; thou
knowest that my country is a magazine of warriors, a mine
of silver, and that I have no need of other lands. I take it that
we have an equal interest in encouraging trade between our
subjects.&rdquo; This peaceful message was well received by the shah,
and in all probability the Mongol armies would never have
appeared in Europe but for an unfortunate occurrence. Shortly
after the despatch of this first mission Jenghiz sent a party of
traders into Transoxiana who were seized and put to death as
spies by Inaljuk, the governor of Otrar. As satisfaction for
this outrage Jenghiz demanded the extradition of the offending
governor. Far from yielding to this summons, however,
Mahommed beheaded the chief of the Mongol envoys, and sent
the others back without their beards. This insult made war
inevitable, and in the spring of 1219 Jenghiz set out from
Karakorum on a campaign which was destined to be as startling
in its immediate results as its ulterior effects were far-reaching.
The invading force was in the first instance divided into two
armies: one commanded by Jenghiz&rsquo;s second son Jagatai was
directed to march against the Kankalis, the northern defenders
of the Khw&#257;rizm empire; and the other, led by Juji, his eldest
son, advanced by way of Sighnak against Jand (Jend). Against
this latter force Mahommed led an army of 400,000 men, who
were completely routed, leaving it is said 160,000 dead upon
the field. With the remnant of his host Mahommed fled to
Samarkand. Meanwhile Jagatai marched down upon the Syr
Daria (Jaxartes) by the pass of Taras and invested Otrar, the
offending city. After a siege of five months the citadel was taken
by assault, and Inaljuk and his followers were put to the sword.
The conquerors levelled the walls with the ground, after having
given the city over to pillage. At the same time a third army
besieged and took Khojent on the Jaxartes; and yet a fourth, led
by Jenghiz and his youngest son Tul&#275;, advanced in the direction
of Bokhara. Tashkent and Nur surrendered on their approach,
and after a short siege Bokhara fell into their hands. On
entering the town Jenghiz ascended the steps of the principal
mosque, and shouted to his followers, &ldquo;The hay is cut; give your
horses fodder.&rdquo; No second invitation to plunder was needed;
the city was sacked, and the inhabitants either escaped beyond
the walls or were compelled to submit to infamies which were
worse than death. As a final act of vengeance the town was
fired, and before the last of the Mongols left the district, the
great mosque and certain palaces were the only buildings left
to mark the spot where the &ldquo;centre of science&rdquo; once stood.
From the ruins of Bokhara Jenghiz advanced along the valley
of the Sogd to Samarkand, which, weakened by treachery, surrendered
to him, as did also Balkh. But in neither case did
submission save either the inhabitants from slaughter or the
city from pillage. Beyond this point Jenghiz went no farther
westward, but sent Tul&#275;, at the head of 70,000 men, to ravage
Khorasan, and two flying columns under Ch&#275;p&#275; and Sabutai
Bahadar to pursue after Mahommed who had taken refuge in
Nishapur. Defeated and almost alone, Mahommed fled before
his pursuers to the village of Astara on the shore of the Caspian
Sea, where he died of an attack of pleurisy, leaving his empire
to his son Jelaledd&#299;n (Jal&#257;l ud-din). Meanwhile Tul&#275; carried his
arms into the fertile province of Khorasan, and after having
captured Nessa by assault appeared before Merv. By an act of
atrocious treachery the Mongols gained possession of the city,
and, after their manner, sacked and burnt the town. From Merv
Tul&#275; marched upon Nishapur, where he met with a most determined
resistance. For four days the garrison fought desperately
on the walls and in the streets, but at length they were overpowered,
and, with the exception of 400 artisans who were sent
into Mongolia, every man, woman and child was slain. Herat
escaped the fate which had overtaken Merv and Nishapur by
opening its gates to the Mongols. At this point of his victorious
career Tul&#275; received an order to join Jenghiz before
Talikhan in Badakshan, where that chieftain was preparing to
renew his pursuit of Jelaledd&#299;n, after a check he had sustained
in an engagement fought before Ghazni. As soon as sufficient
reinforcements arrived Jenghiz advanced against Jelaledd&#299;n,
who had taken up a position on the banks of the Indus. Here
the Turks, though far outnumbered, defended their ground
with undaunted courage, until, beaten at all points, they fled in
confusion. Jelaledd&#299;n, seeing that all was lost, mounted a fresh
horse and jumped into the river, which flowed 20 ft. below.
With admiring gaze Jenghiz watched the desperate venture of
his enemy, and even saw without regret the dripping horseman
mount the opposite bank. From the Indus Jenghiz sent in
pursuit of Jelaledd&#299;n, who fled to Delhi, but failing to capture
the fugitive the Mongols returned to Ghazni after having ravaged
the provinces of Lahore, Peshawar and Melikpur. At this
moment news reached Jenghiz that the inhabitants of Herat
had deposed the governor whom Tul&#275; had appointed over the
city, and had placed one of their own choice in his room. To
punish this act of rebellion Jenghiz sent an army of 80,000
men against the offending city, which after a siege of six months
was taken by assault. For a whole week the Mongols ceased
not to kill, burn and destroy, and 1,600,000 persons are said to
have been massacred within the walls. Having consummated
this act of vengeance, Jenghiz returned to Mongolia by way of
Balkh, Bokhara and Samarkand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ch&#275;p&#275; and Sabutai marched through Azerbeijan,
and in the spring of 1222 advanced into Georgia. Here they
defeated a combined force of Lesghians, Circassians and Kipchaks,
and after taking Astrakhan followed the retreating Kipchaks
to the Don. The news of the approach of the mysterious
enemy of whose name even they were ignorant was received by
the Russian princes at Kiev with dismay. At the instigation,
however, of Mitislaf, prince of Galicia, they assembled an opposing
force on the Dnieper. Here they received envoys from the
Mongol camp, whom they barbarously put to death. &ldquo;You
have killed our envoys,&rdquo; was the answer made by the Mongols;
&ldquo;well, as you wish for war you shall have it. We have done
you no harm. God is impartial; He will decide our quarrel.&rdquo;
In the first battle, on the river Kaleza, the Russians were utterly
routed, and fled before the invaders, who, after ravaging Great
Bulgaria retired, gorged with booty, through the country of
Saksin, along the river Aktuba, on their way to Mongolia.</p>

<p>In China the same success had attended the Mongol arms as in
western Asia. The whole of the country north of the Yellow
river, with the exception of one or two cities, was added to the
Mongol rule, and, on the death of the Kin emperor Süan Tsung
in 1223, the Kin empire virtually ceased to be, and Jenghiz&rsquo;s
frontiers thus became conterminous with those of the Sung
emperors who held sway over the whole of central and
southern China. After his return from Central Asia, Jenghiz
once more took the field in western China. While on this campaign
the five planets appeared in a certain conjunction, which to
the superstitiously minded Mongol chief foretold that evil was
awaiting him. With this presentiment strongly impressed
upon him he turned his face homewards, and had advanced no
farther than the Si-Kiang river in Kansuh when he was seized
with an illness of which he died a short time afterwards (1227)
at his travelling palace at Ha-lao-tu, on the banks of the river
Sale in Mongolia. By the terms of his will Ogotai was appointed
his successor, but so essential was it considered to be that his
death should remain a secret until Ogotai was proclaimed that,
as the funeral procession moved northwards to the great ordu
on the banks of the Kerulen, the escort killed every one they
met. The body of Jenghiz was then carried successively to the
ordus of his several wives, and was finally laid to rest in the
valley of Kilien.</p>

<p>Thus ended the career of one of the greatest conquerors the
world has ever seen. Born and nurtured as the chief of a petty
Mongolian tribe, he lived to see his armies victorious from the
China Sea to the banks of the Dnieper; and, though the empire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
which he created ultimately dwindled away under the hands of
his degenerate descendants, leaving not a wrack behind, we have
in the presence of the Turks in Europe a consequence of his rule,
since it was the advance of his armies which drove their Osmanli
ancestors from their original home in northern Asia, and thus
led to their invasion of Bithynia under Othman, and finally their
advance into Europe under Amurath I.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JENKIN, HENRY CHARLES FLEEMING<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1833-1885), British
engineer, was born near Dungeness on the 25th of March 1833,
his father (d. 1885) being a naval commander, and his mother
(d. 1885) a novelist of some literary repute, her best books perhaps
being <i>Cousin Stella</i> (1859) and <i>Who breaks, pays</i> (1861). Fleeming
Jenkin was educated at first in Scotland, but in 1846 the
family went to live abroad, owing to financial straits, and he
studied at Genoa University, where he took a first-class degree
in physical science. In 1851 he began his engineering career as
apprentice in an establishment at Manchester, and subsequently
he entered Newall&rsquo;s submarine cable works at Birkenhead. In
1859 he began, in concert with Sir William Thomson (afterwards
Lord Kelvin), to work on problems respecting the making and
use of cables, and the importance of his researches on the resistance
of gutta-percha was at once recognized. From this time
he was in constant request in connexion with submarine telegraphy,
and he became known also as an inventor. In partnership
with Thomson, he made a large income as a consulting
telegraph engineer. In 1865 he was elected F.R.S., and was
appointed professor of engineering at University College, London.
In 1868 he obtained the same professorship at Edinburgh University,
and in 1873 he published a textbook of <i>Magnetism and
Electricity</i>, full of original work. He was author of the article
&ldquo;Bridges&rdquo; in the ninth edition of this encyclopaedia. His
influence among the Edinburgh students was pronounced, and
R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s well-known <i>Memoir</i> is a sympathetic tribute
to his ability and character. The meteoric charm of his conversation
is well described in Stevenson&rsquo;s essay on &ldquo;Talk and
Talkers,&rdquo; under the name of Cockshot. Jenkin&rsquo;s interests were
by no means confined to engineering, but extended to the arts and
literature; his miscellaneous papers, showing his critical and
unconventional views, were issued posthumously in two volumes
(1887). In 1882 Jenkin invented an automatic method of
electric transport for goods&mdash;&ldquo;telpherage&rdquo;&mdash;but the completion
of its details was prevented by his death on the 12th of June
1885. A telpher line on his system was subsequently erected
at Glynde in Sussex. He was also well known as a sanitary
reformer, and during the last ten years of his life he did much
useful work in inculcating more enlightened ideas on the subject
both in Edinburgh and other places.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JENKINS, SIR LEOLINE<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (1623-1685), English lawyer and
diplomatist, was the son of a Welsh country gentleman. He was
born in 1623 and was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, of which
he was elected a fellow at the Restoration in 1660, having been an
ardent royalist during the civil war and commonwealth; and in
1661 he became head of the college. In the same year he was
made registrar of the consistory court of Westminster; in 1664
deputy judge of the court of arches; about a year later judge of
the admiralty court; in 1689 judge of the prerogative court of
Canterbury. In these offices Jenkins did enduring work in elucidating
and establishing legal principles, especially in relation to
international law and admiralty jurisdiction. He was selected to
draw up the claim of Charles II. to succeed to the property of his
mother, Henrietta Maria, on her death in August 1666, and while
in Paris for this purpose he succeeded in defeating the rival claim
of the duchess of Orleans, being rewarded by a knighthood on his
return. In 1673, on being elected member for Hythe, Jenkins
resigned the headship of Jesus College. He was one of the
English representatives at the congress of Cologne in 1673, and
at the more important congress of Nijmwegen in 1676-1679.
He was made a privy councillor in February 1680 and
became secretary of state in April of the same year, in which
office he was the official leader of the opposition to the Exclusion
Bill, though he was by no means a pliant tool in the hands of the
court. He resigned office in 1684, and died on the 1st of September
1685. He left most of his property to Jesus College,
Oxford, including his books, which he bequeathed to the college
library, built by himself; and he left some important manuscripts
to All Souls College, where they are preserved. Jenkins left his
impress on the law of England in the Statute of Frauds, and the
Statute of Distributions, of which he was the principal author,
and of which the former profoundly affected the mercantile law
of the country, while the latter regulated the inheritance of the
personal property of intestates. He was never married.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JENKINS, ROBERT<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> (<i>fl.</i> 1731-1745), English master mariner,
is known as the protagonist of the &ldquo;Jenkins&rsquo;s ear&rdquo; incident,
which, magnified in England by the press and the opposition,
became a contributory cause of the war between England and
Spain (1739). Bringing home the brig &ldquo;Rebecca&rdquo; from the West
Indies in 1731, Jenkins was boarded by a Spanish guarda-costa,
whose commander rifled the holds and cut off one of his ears. On
arriving in England Jenkins stated his grievance to the king, and
a report was furnished by the commander-in-chief in the West
Indies confirming his account. At first the case created no great
stir, but in 1738 he repeated his story with dramatic detail
before a committee of the House of Commons, producing what
purported to be the ear that had been cut off. Afterwards it
was suggested that he might have lost the ear in the pillory.</p>

<p>Jenkins was subsequently given the command of a ship in the
East India Company&rsquo;s service, and later became supervisor of the
company&rsquo;s affairs at St Helena. In 1741 he was sent from England
to that island to investigate charges of corruption brought against
the acting governor, and from May 1741 until March 1742 he administered
the affairs of the island. Thereafter he resumed his naval
career, and is stated in an action with a pirate vessel to have preserved
his own vessel and three others under his care (see T. H.

<p><span class="bold">JENNÉ,<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> a city of West Africa, formerly the capital of the
Songhoi empire, now included in the French colony of Upper
Senegal and Niger. Jenné is situated on a marigot or natural
canal connecting the Niger and its affluent the Bani or Mahel
Balevel, and is within a few miles of the latter stream. It lies
250 m. S.W. of Timbuktu in a straight line. The city is surrounded
by channels connected with the Bani but in the
dry season it ceases to be an island. On the north is the
Moorish quarter; on the north-west, the oldest part of the
city, stood the citadel, converted by the French since 1893
into a modern fort. The market-place is midway between the
fort and the commercial harbour. The old mosque, partially
destroyed in 1830, covered a large area in the south-west portion
of the city. It was built on the site of the ancient palace of the
Songhoi kings. The architecture of many of the buildings
bears a resemblance to Egyptian, the façades of the houses being
adorned with great buttresses of pylonic form. There is little
trace of the influence of Moorish or Arabian art. The buildings
are mostly constructed of clay made into flat long bricks.
Massive clay walls surround the city. The inhabitants are great
traders and the principal merchants have representatives at
Timbuktu and all the chief places on the Niger. The boats
built at Jenné are famous throughout the western Sudan.</p>

<p>Jenné is believed to have been founded by the Songhoi in the
8th century, and though it has passed under the dominion of
many races it has never been destroyed. Jenné seems to have
been at the height of its power from the 12th to the 16th century,
when its merchandise was found at every port along the west
coast of Africa. From this circumstance it is conjectured that
Jenné (Guinea) gave its name to the whole coast (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Guinea</a></span>).
Subsequently, under the control of Moorish, Tuareg and Fula
invaders, the importance of the city greatly declined. With the
advent of the French, commerce again began to flourish.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JENNER, EDWARD<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (1749-1823), English physician and
discoverer of vaccination, was born at Berkeley, Gloucestershire,
on the 17th of May 1749. His father, the Rev. Stephen Jenner,
rector of Rockhampton and vicar of Berkeley, came of a family
that had been long established in that county, and was possessed
of considerable landed property; he died when Edward was
only six years old, but his eldest son, the Rev. Stephen Jenner,
brought his brother up with paternal care and tenderness.
Edward received his early education at Wotton-under-Edge
and Cirencester, where he already showed a strong taste for
natural history. The medical profession having been selected
for him, he began his studies under Daniel Ludlow, a
surgeon of Sodbury near Bristol; but in his twenty-first year
he proceeded to London, where he became a favourite pupil
of John Hunter, in whose house he resided for two years.
During this period he was employed by Sir Joseph Banks to
arrange and prepare the valuable zoological specimens which
he had brought back from Captain Cook&rsquo;s first voyage in
1771. He must have acquitted himself satisfactorily in this
task, since he was offered the post of naturalist in the second
expedition, but declined it as well as other advantageous offers,
preferring rather to practise his profession in his native place,
and near his eldest brother, to whom he was much attached. He
was the principal founder of a local medical society, to which
he contributed several papers of marked ability, in one of which
he apparently anticipated later discoveries concerning rheumatic
inflammations of the heart. He maintained a correspondence
with John Hunter, under whose direction he investigated various
points in biology, particularly the hibernation of hedgehogs and
habits of the cuckoo; his paper on the latter subject was laid by
Hunter before the Royal Society, and appeared in the <i>Phil.
Trans.</i> for 1788. He also devoted considerable attention to the
varied geological character of the district in which he lived, and
constructed the first balloon seen in those parts. He was a great
favourite in general society, from his agreeable and instructive
conversation, and the many accomplishments he possessed.
Thus he was a fair musician, both as a part singer and as a performer
on the violin and flute, and a very successful writer, after
the fashion of that time, of fugitive pieces of verse. In 1788 he
married Catherine Kingscote, and in 1792 he obtained the degree
of doctor of medicine from St Andrews.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the discovery that is associated with his name
had been slowly maturing in his mind. When only an apprentice
at Sodbury, his attention had been directed to the relations
between cow-pox and small-pox in connexion with a popular
belief which he found current in Gloucestershire, as to the antagonism
between these two diseases. During his stay in London
he appears to have mentioned the thing repeatedly to Hunter,
who, being engrossed by other important pursuits, was not so
strongly persuaded as Jenner was of its possible importance, yet
spoke of it to his friends and in his lectures. After he began
practice in Berkeley, Jenner was always accustomed to inquire
what his professional brethren thought of it; but he found that,
when medical men had noticed the popular report at all, they
supposed it to be based on imperfect induction. His first careful
investigation of the subject dated from about 1775, and five years
elapsed before he had succeeded in clearing away the most perplexing
difficulties by which it was surrounded. He first
satisfied himself that two different forms of disease had been
hitherto confounded under the term cow-pox, only one of which
protected against small-pox, and that many of the cases of failure
were to be thus accounted for; and his next step was to ascertain
that the true cow-pox itself only protects when communicated
at a particular stage of the disease. At the same time he came
to the conclusion that &ldquo;the grease&rdquo; of horses is the same
disease as cow-pox and small-pox, each being modified by the
organism in which it was developed. For many years, cow-pox
being scarce in his county, he had no opportunity of inoculating
the disease, and so putting his discovery to the test, but he did
all he could in the way of collecting information and communicating
what he had ascertained. Thus in 1788 he carried a
drawing of the cow-pox, as seen on the hands of a milkmaid, to
London, and showed it to Sir E. Home and others, who agreed
that it was &ldquo;an interesting and curious subject.&rdquo; At length,
on the 14th of May 1796, he was able to inoculate James
Phipps, a boy about eight years old, with matter from cow-pox
vesicles on the hand of Sarah Nelmes. On the 1st of the following
July the boy was carefully inoculated with variolous matter,
but (as Jenner had predicted) no small-pox followed. The discovery
was now complete, but Jenner was unable to repeat his
experiment until 1798, owing to the disappearance of cow-pox
from the dairies. He then repeated his inoculations with the
utmost care, and prepared a pamphlet (<i>Inquiry into the Cause and
Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae</i>) which should announce his discovery
to the world. Before publishing it, however, he thought
it well to visit London, so as to demonstrate the truth of his
assertions to his friends; but he remained in London nearly three
months, without being able to find any person who would submit
to be vaccinated. Soon after he had returned home, however,
Henry Cline, surgeon of St Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital, inoculated some
vaccine matter obtained from him over the diseased hip-joint of a
child, thinking the counter-irritation might be useful, and found
the patient afterwards incapable of acquiring small-pox. In the
autumn of the same year, Jenner met with the first opposition to
vaccination; and this was the more formidable because it <span class="correction" title="amended from proceded">proceeded</span>
from J. Ingenhousz, a celebrated physician and man of
science. But meanwhile Cline&rsquo;s advocacy of vaccination brought
it much more decidedly before the medical profession, of whom
the majority were prudent enough to suspend their judgment
until they had more ample information. But besides these
there were two noisy and troublesome factions, one of which
opposed vaccination as a useless and dangerous practice, while
the other endangered its success much more by rash and self-seeking
advocacy. At the head of the latter was George Pearson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
who in November 1798 published a pamphlet speculating upon
the subject, before even seeing a case of cow-pox, and afterwards
endeavoured, by lecturing on the subject and supplying
the virus, to put himself forward as the chief agent in the cause.
The matter which he distributed, which had been derived from
cows that were found to be infected in London, was found frequently
to produce, not the slight disease described by Jenner,
but more or less severe eruptions resembling small-pox. Jenner
concluded at once that this was due to an accidental contamination
of the vaccine with variolous matter, and a visit to London
in the spring of 1799 convinced him that this was the case. In
the course of this year the practice of vaccination spread over
England, being urged principally by non-professional persons of
position; and towards its close attempts were made to found institutions
for gratuitous vaccination and for supplying lymph to
all who might apply for it. Pearson proposed to establish one of
these in London, without Jenner&rsquo;s knowledge, in which he offered
him the post of honorary corresponding physician! On learning
of this scheme to supplant him, and to carry on an institution
for public vaccination on principles which he knew to be partly
erroneous, Jenner once more visited London early in 1800, when
he had influence enough to secure the abandonment of the
project. He was afterwards presented to the king, the queen
and the prince of Wales, whose encouragement materially aided
the spread of vaccination in England. Meanwhile it had made
rapid progress in the United States, where it was introduced by
Benjamin Waterhouse, then professor of physic at Harvard,
and on the continent of Europe, where it was at first diffused
by De Carro of Vienna. In consequence of the war between
England and France, the discovery was later in reaching Paris;
but, its importance once realized, it spread rapidly over France,
Spain and Italy.</p>

<p>A few of the incidents connected with its extension may be
mentioned. Perhaps the most striking is the expedition which
was sent out by the court of Spain in 1803, for the purpose of
diffusing cow-pox through all the Spanish possessions in the
Old and New Worlds, and which returned in three years, having
circumnavigated the globe, and succeeded beyond its utmost
expectations. Clergymen in Geneva and Holland urged vaccination
upon their parishioners from the pulpit; in Sicily, South
America and Naples religious processions were formed for the
purpose of receiving it; the anniversary of Jenner&rsquo;s birthday, or
of the successful vaccination of James Phipps, was for many
years celebrated as a feast in Germany; and the empress of
Russia caused the first child operated upon to receive the
name of Vaccinov, and to be educated at the public expense.
About the close of the year 1801 Jenner&rsquo;s friends in Gloucestershire
presented him with a small service of plate as a testimonial
of the esteem in which they held his discovery. This was intended
merely as a preliminary to the presenting of a petition
to parliament for a grant. The petition was presented in 1802,
and was referred to a committee, of which the investigations
resulted in a report in favour of the grant, and ultimately in a
vote of £10,000.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1802 steps were taken to form a society for
the proper spread of vaccination in London, and the Royal
Jennerian Society was finally established, Jenner returning to
town to preside at the first meeting. This institution began very
prosperously, more than twelve thousand persons having been
inoculated in the first eighteen months, and with such effect that
the deaths from small-pox, which for the latter half of the 18th
century had averaged 2018 annually, fell in 1804 to 622. Unfortunately
the chief resident inoculator soon set himself up as an
authority opposed to Jenner, and this led to such dissensions as
caused the society to die out in 1808.</p>

<p>Jenner was led, by the language of the chancellor of the exchequer
when his grant was proposed, to attempt practice in
London, but after a year&rsquo;s trial he returned to Berkeley. His grant
was not paid until 1804, and then, after the deduction of about
£1000 for fees, it did little more than pay the expenses attendant
upon his discovery. For he was so thoroughly known everywhere
as the discoverer of vaccination that, as he himself said, he
was &ldquo;the vaccine clerk of the whole world.&rdquo; At the same time
he continued to vaccinate gratuitously all the poor who applied
to him on certain days, so that he sometimes had as many as
three hundred persons waiting at his door. Meanwhile honours
began to shower upon him from abroad: he was elected a member
of almost all the chief scientific societies on the continent of
Europe, the first being that of Göttingen, where he was proposed
by J. F. Blumenbach. But perhaps the most flattering
proof of his influence was derived from France. On one occasion,
when he was endeavouring to obtain the release of some of the
unfortunate Englishmen who had been detained in France on
the sudden termination of the Peace of Amiens, Napoleon was
about to reject the petition, when Josephine uttered the name of
Jenner. The emperor paused and exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah, we can
refuse nothing to that name.&rdquo; Somewhat later he did the same
service to Englishmen confined in Mexico and in Austria; and
during the latter part of the great war persons before leaving
England would sometimes obtain certificates signed by him
which served as passports. In his own country his merits were
less recognized. His applications on behalf of French prisoners
in England were less successful; he never shared in any of the
patronage at the disposal of the government, and was even unable
to obtain a living for his nephew George.</p>

<p>In 1806 Lord Henry Petty (afterwards the marquess of Lansdowne)
became chancellor of the exchequer, and was so convinced
of the inadequacy of the former parliamentary grant that
he proposed an address to the Crown, praying that the college of
physicians should be directed to report upon the success of
vaccination. Their report being strongly in its favour, the then
chancellor of the exchequer (Spencer Perceval) proposed that
a sum of £10,000 without any deductions should be paid to
Jenner. The anti-vaccinationists found but one advocate in
the House of Commons; and finally the sum was raised to £20,000.
Jenner, however, at the same time had the mortification of
learning that government did not intend to take any steps
towards checking small-pox inoculation, which so persistently
kept up that disease. About the same time a subscription for
his benefit was begun in India, where his discovery had been
gratefully received, but the full amount of this (£7383) only
reached him in 1812.</p>

<p>The Royal Jennerian Society having failed, the national vaccine
establishment was founded, for the extension of vaccination, in
1808. Jenner spent five months in London for the purpose of
organizing it, but was then obliged, by the dangerous illness of
one of his sons, to return to Berkeley. He had been appointed
director of the institution; but he had no sooner left London
than Sir Lucas Pepys, president of the college of physicians,
neglected his recommendations, and formed the board out of the
officials of that college and the college of surgeons. Jenner at
once resigned his post as director, though he continued to give
the benefit of his advice whenever it was needed, and this resignation
was a bitter mortification to him. In 1810 his eldest son
died, and Jenner&rsquo;s grief at his loss, and his incessant labours,
materially affected his health. In 1813 the university of
Oxford conferred on him the degree of M.D. It was believed
that this would lead to his election into the college of physicians,
but that learned body decided that he could not be admitted
until he had undergone an examination in classics. This Jenner
at once refused; to brush up his classics would, he said, &ldquo;be
irksome beyond measure. I would not do it for a diadem. That
indeed would be a bauble; I would not do it for John Hunter&rsquo;s
museum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He visited London for the last time in 1814, when he was
presented to the Allied Sovereigns and to most of the principal
personages who accompanied them. In the next year his wife&rsquo;s
death was the signal for him to retire from public life: he never
left Berkeley again, except for a day or two, as long as he lived.
He found sufficient occupation for the remainder of his life in
collecting further evidence on some points connected with his
great discovery, and in his engagements as a physician, a
naturalist and a magistrate. In 1818 a severe epidemic of
small-pox prevailed, and fresh doubts were thrown on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
efficacy of vaccination, in part apparently owing to the bad
quality of the vaccine lymph employed. This caused Jenner
much annoyance, which was relieved by an able defence of the
practice, written by Sir Gilbert Blane. But this led him, in
1821, to send a circular letter to most of the medical men in
the kingdom inquiring into the effect of other skin diseases in
modifying the progress of cow-pox. A year later he published
his last work, <i>On the Influence of Artificial Eruptions in Certain
Diseases</i>; and in 1823 he presented his last paper&mdash;&ldquo;On the
Migration of Birds&rdquo;&mdash;to the Royal Society. On the 24th of
January 1823 he retired to rest apparently as well as usual, and
next morning rose and came down to his library, where he was
found insensible on the floor, in a state of apoplexy, and with
the right side paralysed. He never rallied, and died on the
following morning.</p>

<p>A public subscription was set on foot, shortly after his death,
by the medical men of his county, for the purpose of erecting
some memorial in his honour, and with much difficulty a sufficient
sum was raised to enable a statue to be placed in Gloucester
Cathedral. In 1850 another attempt was made to set up a monument
to him; this appears to have failed, but at length, in 1858,
a statue of him was erected by public subscription in London.</p>

at University College, London. He became M.R.C.S. in 1837,
and F.R.C.P. in 1852, and in 1844 took the London M.D. In
1847 he began at the London fever hospital investigations into
cases of &ldquo;continued&rdquo; fever which enabled him finally to make the
distinction between typhus and typhoid on which his reputation
as a pathologist principally rests. In 1849 he was appointed professor
of pathological anatomy at University College, and also
assistant physician to University College Hospital, where he
afterwards became physician (1854-1876) and consulting physician
(1879), besides holding similar appointments at other hospitals.
He was also successively Holme professor of clinical medicine
and professor of the principles and practice of medicine at
University College. He was president of the college of physicians
(1881-1888); he was elected F.R.S. in 1864, and received honorary
degrees from Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh. In 1861 he
was appointed physician extraordinary, and in 1862 physician
in ordinary, to Queen Victoria, and in 1863 physician in ordinary
to the prince of Wales; he attended both the prince consort and
the prince of Wales in their attacks of typhoid fever. In 1868
he was created a baronet. As a consultant Sir William Jenner
had a great reputation, and he left a large fortune when he died,
at Bishop&rsquo;s Waltham, Hants, on the 11th of December 1898,
having then retired from practice for eight years owing to failing
health.</p>

at Heiligenhafen in Holstein on the 15th of February 1837, the
son of a local Danish magistrate, who came of old patrician
Frisian stock. After attending the classical schools at Kiel and
Lübeck, Jensen studied medicine at the universities of Kiel,
Würzburg and Breslau. He, however, abandoned the medical
profession for that of letters, and after engaging for some years
in individual private study proceeded to Munich, where he
associated with men of letters. After a residence in Stuttgart
(1865-1869), where for a short time he conducted the <i>Schwäbische
Volks-Zeitung</i>, he became editor in Flensburg of the
<i>Norddeutsche Zeitung</i>. In 1872 he again returned to Kiel, lived
from 1876 to 1888 in Freiburg im Breisgau, and since 1888 has
been resident in Munich.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Jensen is perhaps the most fertile of modern German writers of
fiction, more than one hundred works having proceeded from his
pen; but only comparatively few of them have caught the public
taste; such are the novels, <i>Karin von Schweden</i> (Berlin, 1878); <i>Die
braune Erica</i> (Berlin, 1868); and the tale, <i>Die Pfeifer von Dusenbach,
Eine Geschichte aus dem Elsass</i> (1884). Among others may be

Hansa</i> (Leipzig, 1885); <i>Aus stiller Zeit</i> (Berlin, 1881-1885); and
<i>Heimath</i> (1901). Jensen also published some tragedies, among

<p><span class="bold">JENYNS, SOAME<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (1704-1787), English author, was born in
London on the 1st of January 1704, and was educated at
St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. In 1742 he was chosen M.P. for
Cambridgeshire, in which his property lay, and he afterwards sat
for the borough of Dunwich and the town of Cambridge. From
1755 to 1780 he was one of the commissioners of the board of
trade. He died on the 18th of December 1787.</p>

<p>For the measure of literary repute which he enjoyed during his
life Jenyns was indebted as much to his wealth and social standing
as to his accomplishments and talents, though both were
considerable. His poetical works, the <i>Art of Dancing</i> (1727) and
<i>Miscellanies</i> (1770), contain many passages graceful and lively
though occasionally verging on licence. The first of his prose
works was his <i>Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil</i>
(1756). This essay was severely criticized on its appearance,
especially by Samuel Johnson in the <i>Literary Magazine</i>. Johnson,
in a slashing review&mdash;the best paper of the kind he ever
wrote&mdash;condemned the book as a slight and shallow attempt to
solve one of the most difficult of moral problems. Jenyns, a
gentle and amiable man in the main, was extremely irritated by
his failure. He put forth a second edition of his work, prefaced
by a vindication, and tried to take vengeance on Johnson after
his death by a sarcastic epitaph.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In 1776 Jenyns published his
<i>View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion</i>. Though
at one period of his life he had affected a kind of deistic scepticism,
he had now returned to orthodoxy, and there seems no reason
to doubt his sincerity, questioned at the time, in defending
Christianity on the ground of its total variance with the principles
of human reason. The work was deservedly praised in its
day for its literary merits, but is so plainly the production of an
amateur in theology that as a scientific treatise it is valueless.</p>

where he was the friend of Garrick, Reynolds, Goldsmith,
Johnson, Burke, Burney and Charles Townshend. His appointment
as master of the horse to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>

administration which were afterwards collected and issued in
book form under the title of <i>The Bachelor, or Speculations of
Jeoffry Wagstaffe</i>. A pension of £300, afterwards doubled,
was granted him, and he held his appointment under twelve
succeeding viceroys. From 1775 he was engaged in the writing
of plays. Among others, his tragedy <i>Braganza</i> was successfully
performed at Drury Lane in 1775, <i>Conspiracy</i> in 1796, <i>The Law
of Lombardy</i> in 1779, and <i>The Count of Narbonne</i> at Covent
Garden in 1781. In 1794 he published an heroic poem <i>Roman

satire on the excesses of the French Revolution. He died at
Blackrock, near Dublin, on the 31st of May 1803.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEPHTHAH,<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> one of the judges of Israel, in the Bible, was an
illegitimate son of Gilead, and, being expelled from his father&rsquo;s
house by his lawful brethren, took refuge in the Syrian land of
Tob, where he gathered around him a powerful band of homeless
men like himself. The Ammonites pressing hard on his countrymen,
the elders of Gilead called for his help, which he consented
to give on condition that in the event of victory he should be
made their head (Judg. xi. 1-xii. 7). His name is best known in
history and literature in connexion with his vow, which led to
the sacrifice of his daughter on his successful return. The reluctance
shown by many writers in accepting the plain sense of the
narrative on this point proceeds to a large extent on unwarranted
assumptions as to the stage of ethical development which had
been reached in Israel in the period of the judges, or at the time
when the narrative took shape. The annual lamentation of
the women for her death suggests a mythical origin (see
Adonis). Attached to the narrative is an account of a quarrel
between Jephthah and the Ephraimites. The latter were
defeated, and their retreat was cut off by the Gileadites, who had
seized the fords of the Jordan. As the fugitives attempted to
cross they were bidden to say &ldquo;shibb&#333;leth&rdquo; (&ldquo;flood&rdquo; or &ldquo;ear
of corn&rdquo;), and those who said &ldquo;sibb&#333;leth&rdquo; (the Ephraimites
apparently being unused to <i>sh</i>), were at once put to death. In
this way 42,000 of the tribe were killed.<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The loose connexion between this and the main narrative, as also
the lengthy speech to the children of Ammon (xi. 14-27), which really
relates to Moab, has led some writers to infer that two distinct
heroes and situations have been combined. See further the commentaries
on the Book of Judges (<i>q.v.</i>), and Cheyne, <i>Ency. Bib.</i>, art.

<p><span class="bold">JERAHMEEL,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (Heb. &ldquo;May God pity&rdquo;), in the Bible, a
clan which with Caleb, the Kenites and others, occupied the
southern steppes of Palestine, probably in the district around
Arad, about 17 m. S. of Hebron. It was on friendly terms with
David during his residence at Ziklag (1 Sam. xxx. 29), and
it was apparently in his reign that the various elements of the
south were united and were reckoned to Israel. This is
expressed in the chronicler&rsquo;s genealogies which make Jerahmeel
and Caleb descendants of Judah (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">David</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Judah</a></span>).</p>

Korah (Num. xvi. 1), it is possible that Jerahmeel, like Caleb and
the Kenites, had moved northwards from Kadesh. Samuel (<i>q.v.</i>)
was of Jerahmeel (1 Sam. i. 1; Septuagint), and the consecutive
Jerahmeelite names Nathan and Zabad (1 Chron. ii. 36) have been
associated with the prophet and officer (Zabud, 1 Kings iv. 5) of the

<p><span class="bold">JERBA,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> an island off the coast of North Africa in the Gulf
of Gabes, forming part of the regency of Tunisia. It is separated
from the mainland by two narrow straits, and save for these
channels blocks the entrance to a large bight identified with
the Lake Triton of the Romans. The western strait, opening
into the Gulf of Gabes, is a mile and a half broad; the eastern
strait is wider, but at low water it is possible to cross to the
mainland by the Tarik-el-Jemil (road of the camel). The
island is irregular in outline, its greatest length and breadth
being some 20 m., and its area 425 sq. m. It contains
neither rivers nor springs, but is supplied with water by wells
and cisterns. It is flat and well wooded with date palms and
olive trees. Pop. 35,000 to 40,000, the bulk of the inhabitants
being Berbers. Though many of them have adopted Arabic
a Berber idiom is commonly spoken. An affinity exists between
the Berbers of Jerba and the Beni Mzab. About 3000 Jews
live apart in villages of their own, and some 400 Europeans,
chiefly Maltese and Greeks, are settled in the island. Jerba has
a considerable reputation for the manufacture of the woollen
tissues interwoven with silk which are known as burnous
stuffs; a market for the sale of sponges is held from November
till March; and there is a considerable export trade in olives,
dates, figs and other fruits. The capital, trading centre and
usual landing-place are at Haumt-es-Suk (market quarter) on
the north side of the island (pop. 2500). Here are a medieval
fort, built by the Spaniards in 1284, and a modern fort, garrisoned
by the French. Gallala, to the south, is noted for the
manufacture of a kind of white pottery, much prized. At El
Kantara (the bridge) on the eastern strait, and formerly connected
with the mainland by a causeway, are extensive ruins
of a Roman city&mdash;probably those of Meninx, once a flourishing
seaport.</p>

<p>Jerba is the Lotophagitis or Lotus-eaters&rsquo; Island of the
Greek and Roman geographers, and is also identified with the
Brachion of Scylax. The modern name appears as early as
the 4th century in Sextus Aurelius Victor. In the middle ages
the possession of Jerba was contested by the Normans of
Sicily, the Spaniards and the Turks, the Turks proving victorious.
In 1560 after the destruction of the Spanish fleet off
the coast of the island by Piali Pasha and the corsair Dragut
the Spanish garrison at Haumt-es-Suk was exterminated, and
a pyramid, 10 ft. broad at the base and 20 ft. high, was built
of their skulls and other bones. In 1848 this pyramid was pulled
down at the instance of the Christian community, and the
bones were buried in the Catholic cemetery. In general, from
the Arab invasion in the 7th century Jerba shared the fortunes
of Tunisia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERBOA,<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> properly the name of an Arabian and North
African jumping rodent mammal, <i>Jaculus aegyptius</i> (also known
as <i>Jaculus</i>, or <i>Dipus</i>, <i>jaculus</i>) typifying the family <i>Jaculidae</i> (or
<i>Dipodidae</i>), but in a wider sense applied to most of the representatives
of that family, which are widely distributed over the
desert and semi-desert tracts of the Old World, although unknown
in Africa south of the Sahara. In all the more typical
members of the family the three middle metatarsals of the long
hind-legs are fused into a cannon-bone; and in the true jerboas
of the genus <i>Jaculus</i> the two lateral toes, with their supporting
metatarsals, are lost, although they are present in the alactagas
(<i>Alactaga</i>), in which, however, as in certain allied genera, only
the three middle toes are functional. As regards the true
jerboas, there is a curious resemblance in the structure of their
hind-legs to that obtaining among birds. In both groups, for
instance, the lower part of the hind-leg is formed by a long,
slender cannon-bone, or metatarsus, terminating inferiorly in
triple condyles for the three long and sharply clawed toes, the
resemblance being increased by the fact that in both cases
the small bone of the leg (fibula) is fused with the large one
(tibia). It may also be noticed that in mammals and birds
which hop on two legs, such as jerboas, kangaroos, thrushes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
finches, the proportionate length of the thigh-bone or femur to
the tibia and foot (metatarsus and toes) is constant, being 2 to 5;
in animals, on the other hand, such as hares, horses and frogs,
which use all four feet, the corresponding lengths are 4 to 7. The
resemblance between the jerboa&rsquo;s and the bird&rsquo;s skeleton is
owing to adaptation to a similar mode of existence. In the
young jerboa the proportion of the femur to the rest of the leg
is the same as in ordinary running animals. Further, at an early
stage of development the fibula is a complete and separate bone,
while the three metatarsals, which subsequently fuse together
to form the cannon-bone, are likewise separate. In addition to
their long hind and short fore limbs, jerboas are mostly characterized
by their silky coats&mdash;of a fawn colour to harmonize with
their desert surroundings&mdash;their large eyes, and long tails and
ears. As is always the case with large-eared animals, the
tympanic bullae of the skull are of unusually large size; the size
varying in the different genera according to that of the ears.
(For the characteristics of the family and of its more important
generic representatives, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rodentia</a></span>.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the Egyptian jerboa the length of the body is 8 in., and that
of the tail, which is long, cylindrical and covered with short hair
terminated by a tuft, 10 in. The five-toed front limbs are extremely
short, while the hind pair are six times as long. When
about to spring, this jerboa raises its body by means of the hinder
extremities, and supports itself at the same time upon its tail,
while the fore-feet are so closely pressed to the breast as to be
scarcely visible, which doubtless suggested the name <i>Dipus</i>, or two-footed.
It then leaps into the air and alights upon its four feet, but
instantaneously erecting itself, it makes another spring, and so on
in such rapid succession as to appear as if rather flying than running.
It is a gregarious animal, living in considerable colonies in burrows,
which it excavates with its nails and teeth in the sandy soil of Egypt
and Arabia. In these it remains during great part of the day,
emerging at night in search of the herbs on which it feeds. It is
exceedingly shy, and this, together with its extraordinary agility,
renders it difficult to capture. The Arabs, however, succeed by
closing up all the exits from the burrows with a single exception, by
which the rodents are forced to escape, and over which a net is
placed for their capture. When confined, they will gnaw through
the hardest wood in order to make their escape. The Persian jerboa
(<i>Alactaga indica</i>) is also a nocturnal burrowing animal, feeding
chiefly on grain, which it stores up in underground repositories,
closing these when full, and only drawing upon them when the supply
of food above ground is exhausted (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jumping Mouse</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERDAN, WILLIAM<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1782-1869), Scottish journalist, was
born on the 16th of April 1782, at Kelso, Scotland. During the
years between 1799 and 1806 he spent short periods in a country
lawyer&rsquo;s office, a London West India merchant&rsquo;s counting-house,
an Edinburgh solicitor&rsquo;s chambers, and held the position of
surgeon&rsquo;s mate on board H.M. guardship &ldquo;Gladiator&rdquo; in Portsmouth
Harbour, under his uncle, who was surgeon. He went to
London in 1806, and became a newspaper reporter. He was in the
lobby of the House of Commons on the 11th of May 1812 when
Spencer Perceval was shot, and was the first to seize the assassin.
By 1812 he had become editor of <i>The Sun</i>, a semi-official Tory
paper; he occasionally inserted literary articles, then quite an
unusual proceeding; but a quarrel with the chief proprietor
brought that engagement to a close in 1817. He passed next to
the editor&rsquo;s chair of the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, which he conducted with
success for thirty-four years. Jerdan&rsquo;s position as editor
brought him into contact with many distinguished writers. An
account of his friends, among whom Canning was a special
intimate, is to be found in his <i>Men I have Known</i> (1866). When
Jerdan retired in 1850 from the editorship of the <i>Literary
Gazette</i> his pecuniary affairs were far from satisfactory. A
testimonial of over £900 was subscribed by his friends; and in
1853 a government pension of 100 guineas was conferred on
him by Lord Aberdeen. He published his <i>Autobiography</i> in
1852-1853, and died on the 11th of July 1869.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEREMIAH,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> in the Bible, the last pre-exilic prophet (<i>fl.</i> 626-586
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>?), son of Hilkiah.</p>

<p><i>Early Days of Jeremiah.</i>&mdash;There must anciently have existed
one or more prose works on Jeremiah and his times, written
partly to do honour to the prophet, partly to propagate those
views respecting Israel&rsquo;s past with which the name of
Jeremiah was associated. Some fragments of this work (or
these works) have come down to us; they greatly add to the
popularity of the Book of Jeremiah. Strict historical truth we
must not ask of them, but they do give us what was believed
concerning Jeremiah in the following age, and we must believe
that the personality so honoured was an extraordinary one.
We have also a number of genuine prophecies which admit
us into Jeremiah&rsquo;s inner nature. These are our best authorities,
but they are deficient in concrete facts. By birth Jeremiah was
a countryman; he came of a priestly family whose estate lay at
Anathoth &ldquo;in the land of Benjamin&rdquo; (xxxii. 3; cf. i. 1). He
came forward as a prophet in the thirteenth year of Josiah
(626 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), still young but irresistibly impelled. Unfortunately the
account of the call and of the object of the divine caller come to
us from a later hand (ch. i.), but we can well believe that the
concrete fact which the prophetic call illuminated was an impending
blow to the state (i. 13-16; cf. ch. iv.). What the blow
exactly was is disputed,<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but it is certain that Jeremiah saw the
gathering storm and anticipated its result, while the statesmen
were still wrapped in a false security. Five years later came
the reform movement produced by the &ldquo;finding&rdquo; of the &ldquo;book
of the law&rdquo; in the Temple in 621 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (2 Kings xxii. 8), and some
critics have gathered from Jer. xi. 1-8 that Jeremiah joined the
ranks of those who publicly supported this book in Jerusalem
and elsewhere. To others this view appears in itself improbable.
How can a man like Jeremiah have advocated any such
panacea? He was indeed not at first a complete pessimist,
but to be a preacher of Deuteronomy required a sanguine temper
which a prophet of the school of Isaiah could not possess. Besides,
there is a famous passage (viii. 8, see R.V.) in which
Jeremiah delivers a vehement attack upon the &ldquo;scribes&rdquo; (or,
as we might render, &ldquo;bookmen&rdquo;) and their &ldquo;false pen.&rdquo; If,
as Wellhausen and Duhm suppose, this refers to Deuteronomy
(<i>i.e.</i> the original Deuteronomy), the incorrectness of the theory
referred to is proved. And even if we think that the phraseology
of viii. 8 applies rather to a body of writings than to a single book,
yet there is no good ground (xi. 1-8 and xxxiv. 12 being of doubtful
origin) for supposing that Jeremiah would have excepted
Deuteronomy from his condemnation.</p>

<p><i>Stages of his Development.</i>&mdash;At first our prophet was not altogether
a pessimist. He aspired to convince the better minds
that the only hope for Israelites, as well as for Israel, lay in
&ldquo;returning&rdquo; to the true Yahweh, a deity who was no mere
national god, and was not to be cajoled by the punctual offering
of costly sacrifices. When Jeremiah wrote iv. 1-4 he evidently
considered that the judgment could even then be averted. Afterwards
he became less hopeful, and it was perhaps a closer
acquaintance with the manners of the capital that served to
disillusionize him. He began his work at Anathoth, but v. 1-5
(as Duhm points out) seems to come from one who has just now
for the first time &ldquo;run to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem,&rdquo;
observing and observed. And what is the result of his expedition?
That he cannot find a single just and honest man; that
high and low, rich and poor, are all ignorant of the true method
of worshipping God (&ldquo;the way of Yahweh,&rdquo; v. 4). It would
seem as if Anathoth were less corrupt than the capital, the moral
state of which so shocked Jeremiah. And yet he does not really
go beyond the great city-prophet Isaiah who calls the men of
Jerusalem &ldquo;a people of Gomorrah&rdquo; (i. 10). With all reverence,
an historical student has to deduct something from both these
statements. It is true that commercial prosperity had put a
severe strain on the old morality, and that contact with other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
peoples, as well as the course of political history, had appeared
to lower the position of the God of Israel in relation to other gods.
Still, some adherents of the old Israelitish moral and religious
standards must have survived, only they were not to be found
in the chief places of concourse, but as a rule in coteries which
handed on the traditions of Amos and Isaiah in sorrowful
retirement.</p>

<p><i>Danger of Book Religion.</i>&mdash;Probably, too, even in the highest
class there were some who had a moral sympathy with Jeremiah;
otherwise we can hardly account for the contents of Deuteronomy,
at least if the book &ldquo;found&rdquo; in the Temple at all resembled the
central portion of our Deuteronomy. And the assumption
seems to be confirmed by the respectful attitude of certain
&ldquo;elders of the land&rdquo; in xxvi. 17 sqq., and of the &ldquo;princes&rdquo; in
xxxvi. 19, 25, towards Jeremiah, which may, at any rate in part,
have been due to the recent reform movement. If therefore
Jeremiah aimed at Deuteronomy in the severe language of viii. 8,
he went too far. History shows that book religion has special
dangers of its own.<a name="fa2o" id="fa2o" href="#ft2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Nevertheless the same incorruptible
adviser also shows that book religion may be necessary as an
educational instrument, and a compromise between the two
types of religion is without historical precedent.</p>

<p><i>Reaction: Opposition to Jeremiah.</i>&mdash;This, however, could not
as yet be recognized by the friends of prophecy, even though it
seemed for a time as if the claims of book religion were rebuffed
by facts. The death of the pious king Josiah at Megiddo in
608 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> dashed the high hopes of the &ldquo;book-men,&rdquo; but meant no
victory for Jeremiah. Its only result for the majority was a
falling back on the earlier popular cultus of the Baals, and on the
heathen customs introduced, or reintroduced, by Josiah&rsquo;s grandfather,
Manasseh. Would that we possessed the section of the
prophet&rsquo;s biography which described his attitude immediately
after the news of the battle of Megiddo! Let us, however, be
thankful for what we have, and notably for the detailed narratives
in chs. xxvi. and xxxvi. The former is dated in the
beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, though Wellhausen suspects
that the date is a mistake, and that the real occasion was the
death of Josiah. The one clear-sighted patriot saw the full
meaning of the tragedy of Megiddo, and for &ldquo;prophesying against
this city&rdquo;&mdash;secured, as men thought, by the Temple (vii. 4)&mdash;he
was accused by &ldquo;the priests, the prophets, and all the people&rdquo; of
high treason. But the divinity which hedged a prophet saved
him. The &ldquo;princes,&rdquo; supported by certain &ldquo;elders&rdquo; and by
&ldquo;the people&rdquo; (quick to change their leaders), succeeded in
quashing the accusation and setting the prophet free. No king,
be it observed, is mentioned. The latter narrative is still more
exciting. In the fourth year of Jehoiakim (= the first of
Nebuchadrezzar, xxv. 1) Jeremiah was bidden to write down &ldquo;all
the words that Yahweh had spoken to him against Jerusalem
(so LXX.), Judah and all the nations from the days of Josiah
onwards&rdquo; (xxxvi. 2). So at least the authors of Jeremiah&rsquo;s
biography tell us. They add that in the next year Jeremiah&rsquo;s
scribe Baruch read the prophecies of Jeremiah first to the people
assembled in the Temple, then to the &ldquo;princes,&rdquo; and then to the
king, who decided his own future policy by burning Baruch&rsquo;s
roll in the brazier. We cannot, however, bind ourselves to this
tradition. Much more probably the prophecy was virtually a
new one (<i>i.e.</i> even if some old passages were repeated yet the
setting was new), and the burden of the prophecy was &ldquo;The
king of Babylon shall come and destroy this land.&rdquo;<a name="fa3o" id="fa3o" href="#ft3o"><span class="sp">3</span></a> We cannot
therefore assent to the judgment that &ldquo;we have, at least as
regards [the] oldest portions [of the book] information considerably
more specific than is usual in the case of the writings
of the prophets.&rdquo;<a name="fa4o" id="fa4o" href="#ft4o"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p><i>Fall of the State.</i>&mdash;Under Zedekiah the prophet was less fortunate.
Such was the tension of feeling that the &ldquo;princes,&rdquo; who
were formerly friendly to Jeremiah, now took up an attitude of
decided hostility to him. At last they had him consigned to a
miry dungeon, and it was the king who (at the instance of the
Cushite Ebed-melech) intervened for his relief, though he remained
a prisoner in other quarters till the fall of Jerusalem
(586 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Nebuchadrezzar, who is assumed to have heard of
Jeremiah&rsquo;s constant recommendations of submission, gave him
the choice either of going to Babylon or of remaining in the
country (chs. xxxviii. seq.). He chose the latter and resided
with Gedaliah, the native governor, at Mizpah. On the murder
of Gedaliah he was carried to Mizraim or Egypt, or perhaps
to the land of Mizrim in north Arabia&mdash;against his will
(chs. xl.-xliii.). How far all this is correct we know not. The
graphic style of a narrative is no sufficient proof of its truth.
Conceivably enough the story of Jeremiah&rsquo;s journey to Egypt
(or Mizrim) may have been imagined to supply a background for
the artificial prophecies ascribed to Jeremiah in chs. xlvi.-li.
A legend in Jerome and Epiphanius states that he was stoned
to death at Daphnae, but the biography, though not averse
from horrors, does not mention this.</p>

<p><i>A Patriot?</i>&mdash;Was Jeremiah really a patriot? The question
has been variously answered. He was not a Phocion, for he
never became the tool of a foreign power. To say with Winckler<a name="fa5o" id="fa5o" href="#ft5o"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
that he was &ldquo;a decided adherent of the Chaldean party&rdquo; is to go
beyond the evidence. He did indeed counsel submission, but
only because his detachment from party gave him a clearness
of vision (cf. xxxviii. 17, 18) which the politicians lacked. How
he suffered in his uphill course he has told us himself (xv. 10-21).
In after ages the oppressed people saw in his love for Israel and
his patient resignation their own realized ideal. &ldquo;And Onias
said, This is the lover of the brethren, he who prayeth much
for the people and the holy city, Jeremiah the prophet of God&rdquo;
(2 Macc. xv. 14). And in proportion as the popular belief in
Jeremiah rose, fresh prophecies were added to the book (notably
those of the new covenant and of the restoration of the people
after seventy years) to justify it. Professor N. Schmidt has gone
further into the character of this sympathetic prophet, <i>Ency. Bib.</i>
&ldquo;Jeremiah,&rdquo; § 5.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Jeremiah&rsquo;s Prophecies.</i>&mdash;It has been said above that our best
authorities are Jeremiah&rsquo;s own prophecies. Which may these be?
Before answering we must again point out (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Isaiah</a></span>) that the
records of the pre-exilic prophets came down in a fragmentary
form, and that these fragments needed much supplementing to adapt
them to the use of post-exilic readers. In Jeremiah, as in Isaiah,
we must constantly ask to what age do the phraseology, the ideas
and the implied circumstances most naturally point? According
to Duhm there are many passages in which metre (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Amos</a></span>)
may also be a factor in our critical conclusions. Jeremiah, he thinks,
always uses the same metre. Giesebrecht, on the other hand,
maintains that there are passages which are certainly Jeremiah&rsquo;s,
but which are not in what Duhm calls Jeremiah&rsquo;s metre; Giesebrecht
also, himself rather conservative, considers Duhm remarkably free
with his emendations. There has also to be considered whether
the text of the poetical passages has not often become corrupt, not
only from ordinary causes but through the misunderstanding and
misreading of north Arabian names on the part of late scribes and
editors, the danger to Judah from north Arabia being (it is held)
not less in pre-exilic times than the danger from Assyria and Babylonia,
so that references to north Arabia are only to be expected.
To bring educated readers into touch with critical workers it is
needful to acquaint them with these various points, the neglect of
any one of which may to some extent injure the results of criticism.</p>

<p>It is a new stage of criticism on which we have entered, so that no
single critic can be reckoned as <i>the</i> authority on Jeremiah. But
since the results of the higher criticism depend on the soundness and
thoroughness of the criticism called &ldquo;lower,&rdquo; and since Duhm has
the advantage of being exceptionally free from that exaggerated
respect for the letters of the traditional text which has survived the
destruction of the old superstitious veneration for the vowel-points,
it may be best to give the student his &ldquo;higher critical&rdquo; results,
dated 1901. Let us premise, however, that the portions mentioned
in the 9th edition of the <i>Ency. Brit.</i> as having been &ldquo;entirely or
in part denied,&rdquo; to Jeremiah, viz. x. 1-16; xxx.; xxxiii.; l.-li. and
lii., are still regarded in their present form as non-Jeremianic.
The question which next awaits decision is whether any part of the
booklet on foreign nations (xxv., xlvi.-li.) can safely be regarded as
Jeremianic. Giesebrecht still asserts the genuineness of xxv. 15-24
(apart from glosses), xlvii. (in the main) and xlix. 7, 8, 10, 11.
Against these views see N. Schmidt, <i>Ency. Bib.</i>, col. 2384.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span></p>

<p>Let us now listen to Duhm, who analyses the book into six
groups of passages. These are (a) i.-xxv., the &ldquo;words of Jeremiah.&rdquo;
(i. 1); (b) xxvi.-xxix., passages from Baruch&rsquo;s biography of Jeremiah;
(c) xxx.-xxxi., the book of the future of Israel and Judah; (d)
xxxii.-xlv., from Baruch; (e) xlvi.-li., the prophecies &ldquo;concerning
the nations&rdquo;;<a name="fa6o" id="fa6o" href="#ft6o"><span class="sp">6</span></a> (f) lii., historical appendix. Upon examining these
groups we find that besides a prose letter (ch. xxix.), about
sixty poetical pieces may be Jeremiah&rsquo;s. A: Anathoth passages
before 621, (a) ii. 2b, 3, 14-28; ii. 29-37; iii. 1-5; iii. 12b, 13, 19, 20;
iii. 21-25; iv. i, 3, 4; these form a cycle, (b) xxxi. 2-6; 15-20; 21,
22; another cycle. (c) iv. 5-8; 11b, 12a, 13, 15-17a; 19-21; 23-26;
29-31; visions and &ldquo;auditions&rdquo; of the impending invasion.
B: Jerusalem passages. (d) v. 1-6a; 6b-9; 10-17; vi. 1-5; 6b-8;
9-14; 16, 17, 20; 22-26a; 27-30; vii. 28, 29; viii. 4-7a; 8, 9, 13;
14-17; viii. 18-23; ix. 1-8; 9 (short song); 16-18; 19-21; x. 19, 20,
22; reign of Josiah, strong personal element. (e) xxii. 10 (Jehoahaz).
xxii. 13-17; probably too xi. 15, 16; xii. 7-12 (Jehoiakim). xxii.
18, 19, perhaps too xxii. 6b, 7; 20-23; and the cycle xiii. 15, 16;
17; 18, 19; 20, 21a, 22-25a, 26, 27 (later, Jehoiakim). xxii. 24;
xxii. 28 (Jehoiachin). (f) Later poems. xiv. 2-10; xv. 5-9; xvi.
5-7; xviii. 13-17; xxiii. 9-12; 13-15; xi. 18-20; xv. 10-12; 15-19a,
and 20, 21; xvii. 9, 10, 14, 16, 17; xviii. 18-20; xx. 7-11; xx. 14-18;
xiv. 17, 18; xvii. 1-4; xxxviii. 24; assigned to the close of Zedekiah&rsquo;s
time.</p>

<p><i>Two Recensions of the Text.</i>&mdash;It has often been said that we have
virtually two recensions of the text, that represented by the Septuagint
and the Massoretic text, and critics have taken different sides,
some for one and some for the other. &ldquo;Recension,&rdquo; however, is
a bad term; it implies that the two texts which undeniably exist
were the result of revising and editing according to definite critical
principles. Such, however, is not the case. It is true that &ldquo;there are
(in the LXX.) many omissions of words, sentences, verses and whole
passages, in fact, that altogether about 2700 words are wanting,
or the eighth part of the Massoretic text&rdquo; (Bleek). It may also be
admitted that the scribes who produced the Hebrew basis of the
Septuagint version, conscious of the unsettled state of the text,
did not shrink from what they considered a justifiable simplification.
But we must also grant that those from whom the &ldquo;written&rdquo;
Hebrew text proceeds allowed themselves to fill up and to repeat
without any sufficient warrant. In each case in which there is a
genuine difference of reading between the two texts, it is for the
critic to decide; often, however, he will have to seek to go behind
what both the texts present in order to constitute a truer text than
either. Here is the great difficulty of the future. We may add to
the credit of the Septuagint that the position given to the prophecies
on &ldquo;the nations&rdquo; (chs. xlvi.-li. in our Bible) in the Septuagint is
probably more original than that in the Massoretic text. On this
point see especially Schmidt, <i>Ency. Bib.</i> &ldquo;Jeremiah (Book)&rdquo; §§ 6
and 21; Davidson, Hastings&rsquo;s <i>Dict. Bible</i>, ii. 573b-575; Driver,
<i>Introduction</i> (8th ed.), pp. 269, 270.</p>

<p>The best German commentary is that of Cornill (1905). A skilful
translation by Driver, with notes intended for ordinary students
(1906) should also be mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="ft1o" id="ft1o" href="#fa1o"><span class="fn">1</span></a> Davidson (Hast., <i>D.B.</i>, ii. 570 b) mentions two views. (1) The
foe might be &ldquo;a creation of his moral presentiment and assigned
to the north as the cloudy region of mystery.&rdquo; (2) The more usual
view is that the Scythians (see Herod, i. 76, 103-106; iv. 1 ) are meant.
Neither of these views is satisfactory. The passage v. 15-17 is too
definite for (1), and as for (2), the idea of a threatened Scythian invasion
lacks a sufficient basis. Those who hold (2) have to suppose that
original references to the Scythians were retouched under the impression
of Chaldean invasions. Hence Cheyne&rsquo;s theory of a north Arabian
invasion from the land of Zaphon = Zibeon (Gen. xxxvi. 2, 14),
<i>i.e.</i> Ishmael. Cf. N. Schmidt, <i>Ency. Bib.</i>, Zibeon, &ldquo;Scythians,&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">JEREMY, EPISTLE OF,<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> an apocryphal book of the Old
Testament. This letter purports to have been written by
Jeremiah to the exiles who were already in Babylon or on the
way thither. The author was a Hellenistic Jew, and not improbably
a Jew of Alexandria. His work, which shows little
literary skill, was written with a serious practical purpose.
He veiled his fierce attack on the idol gods of Egypt by holding
up to derision the idolatry of Babylon. The fact that Jeremiah
(xxix. 1 sqq.) was known to have written a letter of this nature
naturally suggested to a Hellenist, possibly of the 1st century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> or earlier, the idea of a second epistolary undertaking, and
other passages of Jeremiah&rsquo;s prophecy (x. 1-12; xxix. 4-23)
may have determined also its general character and contents.</p>

<p>The writer warned the exiles that they were to remain in
captivity for seven generations; that they would there see the
worship paid to idols, from all participation in which they were
to hold aloof; for that idols were nothing save the work of men&rsquo;s
hands, without the powers of speech, hearing or self-preservation.
They could not bless their worshippers even in the smallest
concerns of life; they were indifferent to moral qualities, and
were of less value than the commonest household objects, and
finally, &ldquo;with rare irony, the author compared an idol to a
scarecrow (v. 70), impotent to protect, but deluding to the
imagination&rdquo; (<span class="sc">Marshall</span>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The date of the epistle is uncertain. It is believed by some
scholars to be referred to in 2 Macc. ii. 2, which says that Jeremiah
charged the exiles &ldquo;not to forget the statutes of the Lord, neither
to be led astray in their minds when they saw images of gold and
silver and the adornment thereof.&rdquo; But the reference is disputed
by Fritzsche, Gifford, Shürer and others. The epistle was included
in the Greek canon. There was no question of its canonicity
till the time of Jerome, who termed it a pseudepigraph.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERÉZ DE LA FRONTERA<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (formerly <span class="sc">Xeres</span>), a town of
southern Spain, in the province of Cadiz, near the right bank
of the river Guadalete, and on the Seville-Cadiz railway, about
7 m. from the Atlantic coast. Pop. (1900), 63,473. Jeréz is
built in the midst of an undulating plain of great fertility. Its
whitewashed houses, clean, broad streets, and squares planted
with trees extend far beyond the limits formerly enclosed by the
Moorish walls, almost entirely demolished. The principal
buildings are the 15th-century church of San Miguel, the 17th-century
collegiate church with its lofty bell-tower, the 16th-century
town-hall, superseded, for official purposes, by a modern
edifice, the bull-ring, and many hospitals, charitable institutions
and schools, including academies of law, medicine and commerce.
But the most characteristic features of Jeréz are the
huge <i>bodegas</i>, or wine-lodges, for the manufacture and storage of
sherry, and the vineyards, covering more than 150,000 acres,
which surround it on all sides. The town is an important
market for grain, fruit and livestock, but its staple trade is in
wine. Sherry is also produced in other districts, but takes
its name, formerly written in English as <i>sherris</i> or <i>xeres</i>, from
Jeréz. The demand for sherry diminished very greatly during
the last quarter of the 19th century, especially in England,
which had been the chief consumer. In 1872 the sherry shipped
from Cadiz to Great Britain alone was valued at £2,500,000;
in 1902 the total export hardly amounted to one-fifth of this
sum. The wine trade, however, still brings a considerable
profit, and few towns of southern Spain display greater commercial
activity than Jeréz. In the earlier part of the 18th century
the neighbourhood suffered severely from yellow fever; but it
was rendered comparatively healthy when in 1869 an aqueduct
was opened to supply pure water. Strikes and revolutionary
disturbances have frequently retarded business in more recent
years.</p>

<p>Jeréz has been variously identified with the Roman Municipium
Seriense; with Asido, perhaps the original of the Moorish
Sherish; and with Hasta Regia, a name which may survive in
the designation of La Mesa de Asta, a neighbouring hill. Jeréz was
taken from the Moors by Ferdinand III. of Castile (1217-1252);
but it was twice recaptured before Alphonso X. finally occupied
it in 1264. Towards the close of the 14th century it received
the title <i>de la Frontera</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;of the frontier,&rdquo; common to
several towns on the Moorish border.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERÉZ DE LOS CABALLEROS,<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> a town of south-western
Spain, in the province of Badajoz, picturesquely situated on
two heights overlooking the river Ardila, a tributary of the
Guadiana, 12 m. E. of the Portuguese frontier. Pop. (1900),
10,271. The old town is surrounded by a Moorish wall with six
gates; the newer portion is well and regularly built, and planted
with numerous orange and other fruit trees. Owing to the lack
of railway communication Jeréz is of little commercial importance;
its staple trade is in agricultural produce, especially in
ham and bacon from the large herds of swine which are reared
in the surrounding oak forests. The town is said to have been
founded by Alphonso IX. of Leon in 1229; in 1232 it was extended
by his son St Ferdinand, who gave it to the knights
templar. Hence the name <i>Jeréz de los Caballeros</i>, &ldquo;Jeréz of
the knights.&rdquo;</p>

camp of the Israelites in Moab before their crossing of
the river. This was the first Canaanite city to be attacked and

of the martyrs and deciphering inscriptions. Pope Liberius

the emperor Julian came to Rome, and Christians felt relieved
from a great dread.</p>

<p>When his student days were over Jerome returned to Strido,
but did not stay there long. His character was formed. He was
a scholar, with a scholar&rsquo;s tastes and cravings for knowledge,
easily excited, bent on scholarly discoveries. From Strido he
went to Aquileia, where he formed some friendships among
the monks of the large monastery, notably with Rufinus, with
whom he was destined to quarrel bitterly over the question of
Origen&rsquo;s orthodoxy and worth as a commentator; for Jerome was
a man who always sacrificed a friend to an opinion, and when he
changed sides in a controversy expected his acquaintances to
follow him. From Aquileia he went to Gaul (366-370), visiting
in turn the principal places in that country, from Narbonne
and Toulouse in the south to Treves on the north-east frontier.
He stayed some time at Treves studying and observing, and it
was there that he first began to think seriously upon sacred
things. From Treves he returned to Strido, and from Strido
to Aquileia. He settled down to literary work in Aquileia
(370-373) and composed there his first original tract, <i>De muliere
septies percussa</i>, in the form of a letter to his friend Innocentius.
Some dispute caused him to leave Aquileia suddenly; and with a
few companions, Innocentius, Evagrius, and Heliodorus being
among them, he started for a long tour in the East. The epistle
to Rufinus (3rd in Vallarsi&rsquo;s enumeration) tells us the route.
They went through Thrace, visiting Athens, Bithynia, Galatia,
Pontus, Cappadocia and Cilicia, to Antioch, Jerome observing
and making notes as they went. He was interested in the
theological disputes and schisms in Galatia, in the two languages
spoken in Cilicia, &amp;c. At Antioch the party remained
some time. Innocentius died of a fever, and Jerome was
dangerously ill. This illness induced a spiritual change, and he
resolved to renounce whatever kept him back from God. His
greatest temptation was the study of the literature of pagan
Rome. In a dream Christ reproached him with caring more
to be a Ciceronian than a Christian. He disliked the uncouth
style of the Scriptures. &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; he prayed, &ldquo;thou knowest
that whenever I have and study secular MSS. I deny thee,&rdquo;
and he made a resolve henceforth to devote his scholarship to
the Holy Scripture. &ldquo;David was to be henceforth his Simonides,
Pindar and Alcaeus, his Flaccus, Catullus and Severus.&rdquo;
Fortified by these resolves he betook himself to a hermit life in
the wastes of Chalcis, S.E. from Antioch (373-379). Chalcis
was the Thebaid of Syria. Great numbers of monks, each in
solitary cell, spent lonely lives, scorched by the sun, ill-clad and
scantily fed, pondering on portions of Scripture or copying MSS.
to serve as objects of meditation. Jerome at once set himself
to such scholarly work as the place afforded. He discovered and
copied MSS., and began to study Hebrew. There also he wrote
the life of St Paul of Thebes, probably an imaginary tale embodying
the facts of the monkish life around him. Just then the
Meletian schism, which arose over the relation of the orthodox
to Arian bishops and to those baptized by Arians, distressed
the church at Antioch (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Meletius of Antioch</a></span>), and Jerome as
usual eagerly joined the fray. Here as elsewhere he had but one
rule to guide him in matters of doctrine and discipline&mdash;the
practice of Rome and the West; for it is singular to see how
Jerome, who is daringly original in points of scholarly criticism,
was a ruthless partisan in all other matters; and, having discovered
what was the Western practice, he set tongue and pen
to work with his usual bitterness (<i>Altercatio luciferiani et
orthodoxi</i>).</p>

<p>At Antioch in 379 he was ordained presbyter. From there he
went to Constantinople, where he met with the great Eastern
scholar and theologian Gregory of Nazianzus, and with his aid
tried to perfect himself in Greek. The result of his studies there
was the translation of the <i>Chronicon</i> of Eusebius, with a continuation<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
of twenty-eight homilies of Origen on Jeremiah and
Ezekiel, and of nine homilies of Origen on the visions of
Isaiah.</p>

<p>In 381 Meletius died, and Pope Damasus interfered in the
dispute at Antioch, hoping to end it. Jerome was called to
Rome in 382 to give help in the matter, and was made secretary
during the investigation. His work brought him into intercourse
with this great pontiff, who soon saw what he could best
do, and how his vast scholarship might be made of use to the
church. Damasus suggested to him to revise the &ldquo;Old Latin&rdquo;
translation of the Bible; and to this task he henceforth devoted
his great abilities. At Rome were published the Gospels (with
a dedication to Pope Damasus, an explanatory introduction,
and the canons of Eusebius), the rest of the New Testament
and the version of the Psalms from the Septuagint known as the
<i>Psalterium romanum</i>, which was followed (<i>c.</i> 388) by the <i>Psalterium
gallicanum</i>, based on the Hexaplar Greek text. These
scholarly labours, however, did not take up his whole time, and
it was almost impossible for Jerome to be long anywhere without
getting into a dispute. He was a zealous defender of that
monastic life which was beginning to take such a large place
in the church of the 4th century, and he found enthusiastic
disciples among the Roman ladies. A number of widows and
maidens met together in the house of Marcella to study the
Scriptures with him; he taught them Hebrew, and preached the
virtues of the celibate life. His arguments and exhortations may
be gathered from many of his epistles and from his tract <i>Adversus
Helvidium</i>, in which he defends the perpetual virginity of Mary
against Helvidius, who maintained that she bore children to
Joseph. His influence over these ladies alarmed their relatives
and excited the suspicions of the regular priesthood and of the
populace, but while Pope Damasus lived Jerome remained secure.
Damasus died, however, in 384, and was succeeded by Siricius,
who did not show much friendship for Jerome. He found it
expedient to leave Rome, and set out for the East in 385. His
letters (especially Ep. 45) are full of outcries against his enemies
and of indignant protestations that he had done nothing unbecoming
a Christian, that he had taken no money, nor gifts
great nor small, that he had no delight in silken attire, sparkling
gems or gold ornaments, that no matron moved him unless by
penitence and fasting, &amp;c. His route is given in the third book <i>In
Rufinum</i>; he went by Rhegium and Cyprus, where he was entertained
by Bishop Epiphanius, to Antioch. There he was joined
by two wealthy Roman ladies, Paula, a widow, and Eustochium,
her daughter, one of Jerome&rsquo;s Hebrew students. They came
accompanied by a band of Roman maidens vowed to live a
celibate life in a nunnery in Palestine. Accompanied by these
ladies Jerome made the tour of Palestine, carefully noting with
a scholar&rsquo;s keenness the various places mentioned in Holy
Scripture. The results of this journey may be traced in his
translation with emendations of the book of Eusebius on the
situation and names of Hebrew places, written probably three
years afterwards, when he had settled down at Bethlehem.
From Palestine Jerome and his companions went to Egypt,
remaining some time in Alexandria, and they visited the convents
of the Nitrian desert. Jerome&rsquo;s mind was evidently full
of anxiety about his translation of the Old Testament, for we find
him in his letters recording the conversations he had with learned
men about disputed readings and doubtful renderings; the blind
Didymus of Alexandria, whom he heard interpreting Hosea,
appears to have been most useful. When they returned to
Palestine they all settled at Bethlehem, where Paula built four
monasteries, three for nuns and one for monks. She was at the
head of the nunneries until her death in 404, when Eustochium
succeeded her; Jerome presided over the fourth monastery.
Here he did most of his literary work and, throwing aside his
unfinished plan of a translation from Origen&rsquo;s Hexaplar text,
translated the Old Testament directly from the Hebrew, with
the aid of Jewish scholars. He mentions a rabbi from Lydda,
a rabbi from Tiberias, and above all rabbi Ben Anina, who
came to him by night secretly for fear of the Jews. Jerome
was not familiar enough with Hebrew to be able to dispense with
such assistance, and he makes the synagogue responsible for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
fully narrated in the first seven chapters of Joshua. There must
be some little exaggeration in the statement that Jericho was
totally destroyed; a hamlet large enough to be enumerated
among the towns of Benjamin (Josh. xviii. 21) must have remained;
but that it was small is shown by the fact that it was
deemed a suitable place for David&rsquo;s ambassadors to retire to
after the indignities put upon them by Hanun (2 Sam. x. 5;
1 Chron. xix. 5). Its refortification was due to a Bethelite named
Hiel, who endeavoured to avert the curse of Joshua by offering
his sons as sacrifices at certain stages of the work (1 Kings xvi.
34). After this event it grew again into importance and became
the site of a college of prophets (2 Kings ii. 4 sqq.) for whom
Elisha &ldquo;healed&rdquo; its poisonous waters. The principal spring
in the neighbourhood of Jericho still bears (among the foreign
residents) the name of Elisha; the natives call it, Ain es-Sultan,
or &ldquo;Sultan&rsquo;s spring.&rdquo; To Jericho the victorious Israelite
marauders magnanimously returned their Judahite captives at
the bidding of the prophet Oded (2 Chron. xxviii. 15). Here
was fought the last fight between the Babylonians and Zedekiah,
wherein the kingdom of Judah came to an end (2 Kings
xxv. 5; Jer. xxxix. 5, lii. 8). In the New Testament Jericho
is connected with the well-known stories of Bar-Timaeus
(Matt. xx. 29; Mark x. 46; Luke xviii. 35) and Zacchaeus
(Luke xix. 1) and with the good Samaritan (Luke x. 30).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The extra-Biblical history of Jericho is as disastrous as are the
records preserved in the Scriptures. Bacchides, the general of the
Syrians, captured and fortified it (1. Macc. ix. 50), Aristobulus
(Jos. <i>Ant.</i> XIV. i. 2) also took it, Pompey (ib. XIV. iv. 1) encamped
here on his way to Jerusalem. Before Herod its inhabitants ran
away (ib. XIV. xv. 3) as they did before Vespasian (<i>Wars</i>, IV. viii. 2).
The reason of this lack of warlike quality was no doubt the enervating
effect of the great heat of the depression in which the city lies, which
has the same effect on the handful of degraded humanity that still
occupies the ancient site.</p>

<p>Few places in Palestine are more fertile. It was the city of
palm trees of the ancient record of the Israelite invasion preserved
in part in Judg. i. 16; and Josephus speaks of its fruitfulness
with enthusiasm (<i>Wars</i> IV. 8, 3). Even now with every possible
hindrance in the way of cultivation it is an important centre of
fruit-growing.</p>

<p>The modern er-R&#299;ha is a poor squalid village of, it is estimated,
about 300 inhabitants. It is not built exactly on the ancient site.
Indeed, the site of Jericho has shifted several times. The mound
of Tell es-Sultan, near &ldquo;Elisha&rsquo;s Fountain,&rdquo; north of the modern
village, no doubt covers the Canaanite town. There are two later
sites, of Roman or Herodian date, one north, the other west, of this.
It was probably the crusaders who established the modern site.
An old tower attributed to them is to be seen in the village, and in
the surrounding mountains are many remains of early monasticism.
Aqueducts, ruined sugar-mills, and other remains of ancient industry
abound in the neighbourhood. The whole district is the private
property of the sultan of Turkey. In 1907-8 the Canaanite Jericho
was excavated under the direction of Prof. Sellin of Vienna.</p>

name of two kings in the Bible.</p>

<p>1. The first king of (north) Israel after the disruption (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Solomon</a></span>). According to the traditions of his early life (1 Kings
xi. 26 sqq. and LXX.), he was an Ephraimite who for his ability
was placed over the forced levy of Ephraim and Manasseh.
Having subsequently incurred Solomon&rsquo;s suspicions he fled to
Shishak, king of Egypt, and remained with him until Rehoboam&rsquo;s
accession. When the latter came to be made king at
Shechem, the old religious centre (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abimelech</a></span>), hopes were
entertained that a more lenient policy would be introduced.
But Rehoboam refused to depart from Solomon&rsquo;s despotic rule,
and was tactless enough to send Adoniram, the overseer of the
<i>corvée</i>. He was stoned to death, and Rehoboam realizing
the temper of the people fled to Jerusalem and prepared for
war. Jeroboam became the recognized leader of the northern
tribes.<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Conflicts occurred (1 Kings xiv. 30), but no details are
preserved except the late story of Rehoboam&rsquo;s son Abijah
in 2 Chron. xiii. Jeroboam&rsquo;s chief achievement was the fortification
of Shechem (his new capital) and of Penuel in east
Jordan. To counteract the influence of Jerusalem he established
golden calves at Dan and Bethel, an act which to later ages was
as gross a piece of wickedness as his rebellion against the legitimate
dynasty of Judah. No notice has survived of Shishak&rsquo;s
invasion of Israel (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rehoboam</a></span>), and after a reign of twenty-two
years Jeroboam was succeeded by Nadab, whose violent death
two years later brought the whole house of Jeroboam to an end.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The history of the separation of Judah and Israel in the 10th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> was written from a strong religious standpoint at a
date considerably later than the event itself. The visit of Ahijah
to Shiloh (xi. 29-39), to announce symbolically the rending of the
kingdom, replaces some account of a rebellion in which Jeroboam
&ldquo;lifted up his hand&rdquo; (<i>v.</i> 27) against Solomon. To such an account,
not to the incident of Ahijah and the cloak, his flight (<i>v.</i> 40) is the
natural sequel. The story of Ahijah&rsquo;s prophecy against Jeroboam
(ch. xiv.) is not in the original LXX., but another version of the same
narrative appears at xii. 24 (LXX.), in which there is no reference
to a previous promise to Jeroboam through Ahijah, but the prophet
is introduced as a new character. Further, in this version (xii. 24)
the incident of the tearing of the cloak is related of Shemaiah and
placed at the convention of Shechem. Shemaiah is the prophet
who counselled Rehoboam to refrain from war (xii. 21-24); the injunction
is opposed to xiv. 30, but appears to be intended to explain
Rehoboam&rsquo;s failure to overcome north Israel. (See W. R. Smith,
<i>Old Test. in Jewish Church</i> (2nd ed.), 117 sqq.; Winckler, <i>Alte Test.
Untersuch.</i> 12 sqq., and J. Skinner, <i>Century Bible: Kings</i>, pp. 443 sqq.)</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Jeroboam</span>, son of Joash (2) a contemporary of Azariah
king of Judah. He was one of the greatest of the kings of
Israel. He succeeded in breaking the power of Damascus,
which had long been devastating his land, and extended his
kingdom from Hamath on the Orontes to the Dead Sea. The
brief summary of his achievements preserved in 2 Kings xiv. 23
sqq. may be supplemented by the original writings of Amos and
Hosea.<a name="fa2q" id="fa2q" href="#ft2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a> There appears to be an allusion in Amos vi. 13 to
the recovery of Ashteroth-Karnaim and Lodebar in E. Jordan,
and the conquest of Moab (Isa. xv. seq.) is often ascribed to
this reign. After a period of prosperity, internal disturbances
broke out and the northern kingdom hastened to its fall. Jeroboam
was succeeded by his son Zechariah, who after six months
was killed at Ibleam (so read in 2 Kings xv. 10; cp. ix. 27,
murder of Ahaziah) by Shallum the son of Jabesh&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> possibly
of Jabesh-Gilead&mdash;who a month later fell to Menahem (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEROME, ST<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Hieronymus</span>, in full <span class="sc">Eusebius Sophronius
Hieronymus</span>) (<i>c.</i> 340-420), was born at Strido (modern
Strigau?), a town on the border of Dalmatia fronting Pannonia,
destroyed by the Goths in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 377. What is known of Jerome
has mostly been recovered from his own writings. He appears to
have been born about 340; his parents were Christians, orthodox
though living among people mostly Arians and wealthy.
He was at first educated at home, Bonosus, a life-long friend,
sharing his youthful studies, and was afterwards sent to Rome.
Donatus taught him grammar and explained the Latin poets.
Victorinus taught him rhetoric. He attended the law-courts,
and listened to the Roman advocates pleading in the Forum.
He went to the schools of philosophy, and heard lectures on
Plato, Diogenes, Clitomachus and Carneades; the conjunction
of names show how philosophy had become a dead tradition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
accuracy of his version: &ldquo;Let him who would challenge aught
in this translation,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;ask the Jews.&rdquo; The result of all
this labour was the Latin translation of the Scriptures which,
in spite of much opposition from the more conservative party in
the church, afterwards became the Vulgate or authorized version;
but the Vulgate as we have it now is not exactly Jerome&rsquo;s
Vulgate, for it suffered a good deal from changes made under the
influence of the older translations; the text became very corrupt
during the middle ages, and in particular all the Apocrypha,
except Tobit and Judith, which Jerome translated from the
Chaldee, were added from the older versions. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bible</a></span>:
<i>O.T. Versions</i>.)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the labour involved in translating the
Scriptures, Jerome found time to do a great deal of literary work,
and also to indulge in violent controversy. Earlier in life he
had a great admiration for Origen, and translated many of his
works, and this lasted after he had settled at Bethlehem, for in
389 he translated Origen&rsquo;s homilies on Luke; but he came to
change his opinion and wrote violently against two admirers of
the great Alexandrian scholar, John, bishop of Jerusalem, and
his own former friend Rufinus.</p>

<p>At Bethlehem also he found time to finish <i>Didymi de spiritu
sancto liber</i>, a translation begun at Rome at the request of Pope
Damasus, to denounce the revival of Gnostic heresies by Jovinianus
and Vigilantius (<i>Adv. Jovinianum lib. II.</i> and <i>Contra
Vigilantium liber</i>), and to repeat his admiration of the hermit
life in his <i>Vita S. Hilarionis eremitae</i>, in his <i>Vita Malchi monachi
captivi</i>, in his translations of the Rule of St Pachomius (the
Benedict of Egypt), and in his <i>S. Pachomii et S. Theodorici
epistolae et verba mystica</i>. He also wrote at Bethlehem <i>De viris
illustribus sive de scriptoribus ecclesiasticis</i>, a church history in
biographies, ending with the life of the author; <i>De nominibus
Hebraicis</i>, compiled from Philo and Origen; and <i>De situ et nominibus
locorum Hebraicorum</i>.<a name="fa1r" id="fa1r" href="#ft1r"><span class="sp">1</span></a> At the same place, too, he wrote
<i>Quaestiones Hebraicae</i> on Genesis,<a name="fa2r" id="fa2r" href="#ft2r"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and a series of commentaries
on Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, the Twelve Minor Prophets,
Matthew and the Epistles of St Paul. About 394 Jerome came
to know Augustine, for whom he held a high regard. He
engaged in the Pelagian controversy with more than even his
usual bitterness (<i>Dialogi contra pelagianos</i>); and it is said that
the violence of his invective so provoked his opponents that an
armed mob attacked the monastery, and that Jerome was forced
to flee and to remain in concealment for nearly two years. He
returned to Bethlehem in 418, and after a lingering illness died
on the 30th of September 420.</p>

<p>Jerome &ldquo;is one of the few Fathers to whom the title of Saint
appears to have been given in recognition of services rendered to
the Church rather than for eminent sanctity. He is the great
Christian scholar of his age, rather than the profound theologian
or the wise guide of souls.&rdquo; His great work was the Vulgate,
but his achievements in other fields would have sufficed to distinguish
him. His commentaries are valuable because of his
knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, his varied interests, and his
comparative freedom from allegory. To him we owe the distinction
between canonical and apocryphal writings; in the
<i>Prologus Galeatus</i> prefixed to his version of Samuel and Kings, he
says that the church reads the Apocrypha &ldquo;for the edification of
the people, not for confirming the authority of ecclesiastical doctrines.&rdquo;
He was a pioneer in the fields of patrology and of biblical
archaeology. In controversy he was too fond of mingling
personal abuse with legitimate argument, and this weakness
mars his letters, which were held in high admiration in the early
middle ages, and are valuable for their history of the man and
his times. Luther in his <i>Table Talk</i> condemns them as dealing
only with fasting, meats, virginity, &amp;c. &ldquo;If he only had insisted
upon the works of faith and performed them! But he teaches
nothing either about faith, or love, or hope, or the works of
faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">JEROME OF PRAGUE<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (d. 1416), an early Bohemian church-reformer
and friend of John Hus. Jerome&rsquo;s part in the Hussite
movement was formerly much over-rated. Very little is known
of his early years. He is stated to have belonged to a noble
Bohemian family<a name="fa1s" id="fa1s" href="#ft1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and to have been a few years younger than
Hus. After beginning his studies at the university of Prague,
where he never attempted to obtain any ecclesiastical office,
Jerome proceeded to Oxford in 1398. There he became greatly
impressed by the writings of Wycliffe, of whose <i>Dialogus</i> and
<i>Trialogus</i> he made copies. Always inclined to a roving life, he
soon proceeded to the university of Paris and afterwards continued
his studies at Cologne and Heidelberg, returning to
Prague in 1407. In 1403 he is stated to have undertaken a
journey to Jerusalem. At Paris his open advocacy of the views
of Wycliffe brought him into conflict with John Gerson, chancellor
of the university. In Prague Jerome soon attracted
attention by his advanced and outspoken opinions. He gave
great offence also by exhibiting a portrait of Wycliffe in his room.
Jerome was soon on terms of friendship with Hus, and took part
in all the controversies of the university. When in 1408 a
French embassy arrived at Kutná Hora, the residence of King
Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and proposed that the papal schism
should be terminated by the refusal of the temporal authorities
further to recognize either of the rival popes, Wenceslaus summoned
to Kutná Hora the members of the university. The
Bohemian <i>magistri</i> spoke strongly in favour of the French proposals,
while the Germans maintained their allegiance to the
Roman pope, Gregory XII. The reorganization of the university
was also discussed, and as Wenceslaus for a time favoured
the Germans, Hus and Jerome, as leaders of the Bohemians,
incurred the anger of the king, who threatened them with death
by fire should they oppose his will.</p>

<p>In 1410 Jerome, who had incurred the hostility of the archbishop
of Prague by his speeches in favour of Wycliffe&rsquo;s teaching,
went to Ofen, where King Sigismund of Hungary resided, and,
though a layman, preached before the king denouncing strongly
the rapacity and immorality of the clergy. Sigismund shortly
afterwards received a letter from the archbishop of Prague containing
accusations against Jerome. He was imprisoned by
order of the king, but does not appear to have been detained
long in Hungary. Appearing at Vienna, he was again brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
before the ecclesiastical authorities. He was accused of spreading
Wycliffe&rsquo;s doctrines, and his general conduct at Oxford, Paris,
Cologne, Prague and Ofen was censured. Jerome vowed that
he would not leave Vienna till he had cleared himself from the
accusation of heresy. Shortly afterwards he secretly left Vienna,
declaring that this promise had been forced on him. He went
first to Vöttau in Moravia, and then to Prague. In 1412 the
representatives of Pope Gregory XII. publicly offered indulgences
for sale at Prague, wishing to raise money for the pope&rsquo;s
campaign against King Ladislaus of Naples, an adherent of the
antipope of Avignon. Contrary to the wishes of the archbishop
of Prague a meeting of the members of the university took place,
at which both Hus and Jerome spoke strongly against the sale
of indulgences. The fiery eloquence of Jerome, which is noted
by all contemporary writers, obtained for him greater success
even than that of Hus, particularly among the younger students,
who conducted him in triumph to his dwelling-place. Shortly
afterwards Jerome proceeded to Poland&mdash;it is said on the invitation
of King Wladislaus. His courtly manners and his eloquence
here also caused him to become very popular, but he again met
with strong opposition from the Roman Church. While travelling
with the grand-duke Lithold of Lithuania Jerome took part
in the religious services of the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>During his stay in northern Europe Jerome received the news
that Hus had been summoned to appear before the council of
Constance. He wrote to his friend advising him to do so and
adding that he would also proceed there to afford him assistance.
Contrary to the advice of Hus he arrived at Constance on the
4th of April 1415. Advised to fly immediately to Bohemia, he
succeeded in reaching Hirschau, only 25 m. from the Bohemian
frontier. He was here arrested and brought back in chains to
Constance, where he was examined by judges appointed by the
council. His courage failed him in prison and, to regain his
freedom, he renounced the doctrines of Wycliffe and Hus. He
declared that Hus had been justly executed and stated in a letter
addressed on the 12th of August 1415 to Lacek, lord of Kravâ&#345;&mdash;the
only literary document of Jerome that has been preserved&mdash;that
&ldquo;the dead man (Hus) had written many false and harmful
things.&rdquo; Full confidence was not placed in Jerome&rsquo;s recantation.
He claimed to be heard at a general meeting of the council, and
this was granted to him. He now again maintained all the theories
which he had formerly advocated, and, after a trial that
lasted only one day, he was condemned to be burnt as a heretic.
The sentence was immediately carried out on the 30th of May
1416, and he met his death with fortitude. As Poggio Bracciolini
writes, &ldquo;none of the Stoics with so constant and brave a soul
endured death, which he (Jerome) seemed rather to long for.&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">JERROLD, DOUGLAS WILLIAM<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1803-1857), English
dramatist and man of letters, was born in London on the 3rd
of January 1803. His father, Samuel Jerrold, actor, was at that
time lessee of the little theatre of Wilsby near Cranbrook in Kent,
but in 1807 he removed to Sheerness. There, among the bluejackets
who swarmed in the port during the war with France,
Douglas grew into boyhood. He occasionally took a child&rsquo;s
part on the stage, but his father&rsquo;s profession had little attraction
for the boy. In December 1813 he joined the guardship
&ldquo;Namur,&rdquo; where he had Jane Austen&rsquo;s brother as captain, and he
served as a midshipman until the peace of 1815. He saw nothing
of the war save a number of wounded soldiers from Waterloo;
but till his dying day there lingered traces of his early passion for
the sea. The peace of 1815 ruined Samuel Jerrold; there was
no more prize money. On the 1st of January 1816 he removed
with his family to London, where the ex-midshipman began the
world again as a printer&rsquo;s apprentice, and in 1819 became a compositor
in the printing-office of the <i>Sunday Monitor</i>. Several
short papers and copies of verses by him had already appeared
in the sixpenny magazines, and one evening he dropped into the
editor&rsquo;s box a criticism of the opera <i>Der Freischütz</i>. Next
morning he received his own copy to set up, together with a
flattering note from the editor, requesting further contributions
from the anonymous author. Thenceforward Jerrold was engaged
in journalism. In 1821 a comedy that he had composed
in his fifteenth year was brought out at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells theatre,
under the title <i>More Frightened than Hurt</i>. Other pieces
followed, and in 1825 he was engaged for a few pounds weekly
to produce dramas and farces to the order of Davidge of the
Coburg theatre. In the autumn of 1824 the &ldquo;little Shakespeare
in a camlet cloak,&rdquo; as he was called, married Mary Swann;
and, while he was engaged with the drama at night, he was
steadily pushing his way as a journalist. For a short while he
was part proprietor of a small Sunday newspaper. In 1829,
through a quarrel with the exacting Davidge, Jerrold left the
Coburg; and his three-act melodrama, <i>Black-eyed Susan; or, All
in the Downs</i>, was brought out by R. W. Elliston at the Surrey
theatre. The success of the piece was enormous. With its
free gallant sea-flavour, it took the town by storm, and &ldquo;all
London went over the water to see it.&rdquo; Elliston made a fortune
by the piece; T. P. Cooke, who played William, made his reputation;
Jerrold received about £60 and was engaged as dramatic
author at five pounds a week. But his fame as a dramatist
was achieved. In 1830 it was proposed that he should adapt
something from the French for Drury Lane. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was his
reply, &ldquo;I shall come into this theatre as an original dramatist
or not at all.&rdquo; <i>The Bride of Ludgate</i> (December 8, 1831)
was the first of a number of his plays produced at Drury Lane.
The other patent houses threw their doors open to him also (the
Adelphi had already done so); and in 1836 Jerrold became co-manager
of the Strand theatre with W. J. Hammond, his brother-in-law.
The venture was not successful, and the partnership
was dissolved. While it lasted Jerrold wrote his only tragedy,
<i>The Painter of Ghent</i>, and himself appeared in the title-rôle, without
any very marked success. He continued to write sparkling
comedies till 1854, the date of his last piece, <i>The Heart of Gold</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had won his way to the pages of numerous
periodicals&mdash;before 1830 of the second-rate magazines only, but
after that to those of more importance. He was a contributor
to the <i>Monthly Magazine, Blackwood&rsquo;s,</i> the <i>New Monthly</i>, and
the <i>Athenaeum</i>. To <i>Punch</i>, the publication which of all others
is associated with his name, he contributed from its second
number in 1841 till within a few days of his death. He founded
and edited for some time, though with indifferent success, the
<i>Illuminated Magazine, Jerrold&rsquo;s Shilling Magazine</i>, and <i>Douglas
Jerrold&rsquo;s Weekly Newspaper;</i> and under his editorship <i>Lloyd&rsquo;s
Weekly Newspaper</i> rose from almost nonentity to a circulation of
182,000. The history of his later years is little more than a
catalogue of his literary productions, interrupted now and again
by brief visits to the Continent or to the country. Douglas
Jerrold died at his house, Kilburn Priory, in London, on the
8th of June 1857.</p>

<p>Jerrold&rsquo;s figure was small and spare, and in later years bowed
almost to deformity. His features were strongly marked and
expressive from the thin humorous lips to the keen blue eyes
gleaming from beneath the shaggy eyebrows. He was brisk and
active, with the careless bluffness of a sailor. Open and sincere,
he concealed neither his anger nor his pleasure; to his simple
frankness all polite duplicity was distasteful. The cynical side
of his nature he kept for his writings; in private life his hand was
always open. In politics Jerrold was a Liberal, and he gave eager
sympathy to Kossuth, Mazzini and Louis Blanc. In social
politics especially he took an eager part; he never tired of declaiming
against the horrors of war, the luxury of bishops, and
the iniquity of capital punishment.</p>

<p>Douglas Jerrold is now perhaps better known from his reputation
as a brilliant wit in conversation than from his writings. As
a dramatist he was very popular, though his plays have not kept
the stage. He dealt with rather humbler forms of social life
than had commonly been represented on the boards. He was
one of the first and certainly one of the most successful of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
who in defence of the native English drama endeavoured to
stem the tide of translation from the French, which threatened
early in the 19th century altogether to drown original native
talent. His skill in construction and his mastery of epigram
and brilliant dialogue are well exemplified in his comedy, <i>Time
Works Wonders</i> (Haymarket, April 26, 1845). The tales and
sketches which form the bulk of Jerrold&rsquo;s collected works
vary much in skill and interest; but, although there are
evident traces of their having been composed from week to
week, they are always marked by keen satirical observation
and pungent wit.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among the best known of his numerous works are: <i>Men of
Character</i> (1838), including &ldquo;Job Pippin: The man who couldn&rsquo;t
help it,&rdquo; and other sketches of the same kind; <i>Cakes and Ale</i> (2 vols.,
1842), a collection of short papers and whimsical stories; some more
serious novels&mdash;<i>The Story of a Feather</i> (1844), <i>The Chronicles of
Clovernook</i> (1846), <i>A Man made of Money</i> (1849); and <i>St Giles and St
James</i> (1851); and various series of papers reprinted from <i>Punch&mdash;Punch&rsquo;s
Letters to his Son</i> (1843), <i>Punch&rsquo;s Complete Letter-writer</i>
(1845), and the famous <i>Mrs Caudle&rsquo;s Curtain Lectures</i> (1846).</p>

<p>See W. B. Jerrold, <i>Life and Remains of Douglas Jerrold</i> (1859).
A collected edition of his writings appeared in 1851-1854, and <i>The
Works of Douglas Jerrold</i>, with a memoir by his son, W. B. Jerrold,
in 1863-1864; but neither is complete. Among the numerous
selections from his tales and witticisms are two edited by his grandson,
Walter Jerrold, <i>Bons Mots of Charles Dickens and Douglas
Jerrold</i> (new ed. 1904), and <i>The Essays of Douglas Jerrold</i> (1903),
illustrated by H. M. Brock. See also <i>The Wit and Opinions of Douglas
Jerrold</i> (1858), edited by W. B. Jerrold.</p>
</div>

<p>His eldest son, <span class="sc">William Blanchard Jerrold</span> (1826-1884),
English journalist and author, was born in London on the 23rd
of December 1826, and abandoning the artistic career for which
he was educated, began newspaper work at an early age there.
He was appointed Crystal Palace commissioner to Sweden in
1853, and wrote <i>A Brage-Beaker with the Swedes</i> (1854) on his
return. In 1855 he was sent to the Paris exhibition as correspondent
for several London papers, and from that time he lived
much in Paris. In 1857 he succeeded his father as editor of
<i>Lloyd&rsquo;s Weekly Newspaper</i>, a post which he held for twenty-six
years. During the Civil War in America he strongly supported
the North, and several of his leading articles were reprinted and
placarded in New York by the federal government. He was the
founder and president of the English branch of the international
literary association for the assimilation of copyright laws.
Four of his plays were successfully produced on the London stage,
the popular farce <i>Cool as a Cucumber</i> (Lyceum 1851) being the
best known. His French experiences resulted in a number of
books, most important of which is his <i>Life of Napoleon III</i>.
(1874). He was occupied in writing the biography of Gustave
Doré, who had illustrated several of his books, when he died on
the 10th of March 1884.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among his books are <i>A Story of Social Distinction</i> (1848), <i>Life and
Remains of Douglas Jerrold</i> (1859), <i>Up and Down in the World</i> (1863),
<i>The Children of Lutetia</i> (1864), <i>Cent per Cent</i> (1871), <i>At Home in Paris</i>
(1871), <i>The Best of all Good Company</i> (1871-1873), and <i>The Life of
George Cruikshank</i> (1882).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERSEY, EARLS OF.<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> Sir Edward Villiers (<i>c.</i> 1656-1711),
son of Sir Edward Villiers (1620-1689), of Richmond, Surrey,
was created Baron Villiers and Viscount Villiers in 1691 and earl
of Jersey in 1697. His grandfather, Sir Edward Villiers (<i>c.</i> 1585-1626),
master of the mint and president of Munster, was half-brother
of George Villiers, 1st duke of Buckingham, and
of Christopher Villiers, 1st earl of Anglesey; his sister was
Elizabeth Villiers, the mistress of William III., and afterwards
countess of Orkney. Villiers was knight-marshal of
the royal household in succession to his father; master of the
horse to Queen Mary; and lord chamberlain to William III. and
Queen Anne. In 1696 he represented his country at the congress
of Ryswick; he was ambassador at the Hague, and after becoming
an earl was ambassador in Paris. In 1699 he was made secretary
of state for the southern department, and on three occasions he
was one of the lords justices of England. In 1704 he was dismissed
from office by Anne, and after this event he was concerned
in some of the Jacobite schemes. He died on the 25th of August
1711. The 2nd earl was his son William (<i>c.</i> 1682-1721), an
adherent of the exiled house of Stuart, and the 3rd earl was the
latter&rsquo;s son William (d. 1769), who succeeded his kinsman John
Fitzgerald (<i>c.</i> 1692-1766) as 6th Viscount Grandison. The 3rd
earl&rsquo;s son, George Bussy, the 4th earl (1735-1805), held several
positions at the court of George III., and on account of his
courtly manners was called the &ldquo;prince of Maccaronies.&rdquo; The
4th earl&rsquo;s son, George, 5th earl of Jersey (1773-1859), one of the
most celebrated fox-hunters of his time and a successful owner
of racehorses, married Sarah Sophia (1785-1867), daughter of
John Fane, 10th earl of Westmorland, and granddaughter of
Robert Child, the banker. She inherited her grandfather&rsquo;s
great wealth, including his interest in Child&rsquo;s bank, and with her
husband took the name of Child-Villiers. Since this time the
connexions of the earls of Jersey with Child&rsquo;s bank has been maintained.
Victor Albert George Child-Villiers (b. 1845) succeeded
his father George Augustus (1808-1859), 6th earl, who had only
held the title for three weeks, as 7th earl of Jersey in 1859.
This nobleman was governor of New South Wales from 1890
to 1893.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERSEY,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> the largest of the Channel Islands, belonging to
Great Britain. Its chief town, St Helier, on the south coast of
the island, is in 49° 12&prime; N., 2° 7&prime; W., 105 m. S. by E. of Portland
Bill on the English coast, and 24 m. from the French coast to the
east. Jersey is the southernmost of the more important islands
of the group. It is of oblong form with a length of 10 m. from
east to west and an extreme breadth of 6¼ m. The area is 28,717
acres, or 45 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 52,576.</p>

<p>The island reaches its greatest elevation (nearly 500 ft.) in the
north, the land rising sharply from the north coast, and displaying
bold and picturesque cliffs towards the sea. The east, south
and west coasts consist of a succession of large open bays, shallow
and rocky, with marshy or sandy shores separated by rocky headlands.
The principal bays are Grève au Lançons, Grève de
Lecq, St John&rsquo;s and Bouley Bays on the north coast; St Catherine&rsquo;s
and Grouville Bays on the east; St Clement&rsquo;s, St Aubin&rsquo;s
and St Brelade&rsquo;s Bays on the south; and St Ouen&rsquo;s Bay, the wide
sweep of which occupies nearly the whole of the west coast.
The sea in many places has encroached greatly on the land, and
sand drifts have been found troublesome, especially on the west
coast. The surface of the country is broken by winding valleys
having a general direction from north to south, and as they
approach the south uniting so as to form small plains. The
lofty hedges which bound the small enclosures into which Jersey
is divided, the trees and shrubberies which line the roads and
cluster round the uplands and in almost every nook of the valleys
unutilized for pasturage or tillage, give the island a luxuriant
appearance, neutralizing the bare effect of the few sandy plains
and sand-covered hills. Fruits and flowers indigenous to warm
climates grow freely in the open air. The land, under careful
cultivation, is rich and productive, the soil being generally a
deep loam, especially in the valleys, but in the west shallow, light
and sandy. The subsoil is usually gravel, but in some parts an
unfertile clay. Some two-thirds of the total area is under
cultivation, great numbers of cattle being pastured, and much
market gardening practised. The potato crop is very large.
The peasants take advantage of every bit of wall and every
isolated nook of ground for growing fruit trees. Grapes are
ripened under glass; oranges can be grown in sheltered situations,
but the most common fruits are apples, which are used for cider,
and pears. A manure of burnt sea-weed (<b>vraic</b>) is generally
used. The pasturage is very rich, and is much improved by the
application of this manure to the surface. The breed of cattle
is kept pure by stringent laws against the importation of foreign
animals. The milk is used almost exclusively to manufacture
butter. The cattle are always housed in winter, but remain out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
at night from May till October. There was formerly a small
black breed of horses peculiar to the island, but horses are now
chiefly imported from France or England. Pigs are kept
principally for local consumption, and only a few sheep are
reared. Fish are not so plentiful as round the shores of Guernsey,
but mackerel, turbot, cod, mullet and especially the conger eel
are abundant at the Minquiers. There is a large oyster bed
between Jersey and France, but partly on account of over-dredging
the supply is not so abundant as formerly. There is
a great variety of other shell fish. The fisheries, ship-building
and boat-building employ many of the inhabitants. Kelp and
iodine are manufactured from sea-weed. The principal exports
are granite, fruit and vegetables (especially potatoes), butter
and cattle; and the chief imports coal and articles of human consumption.
Communications with England are maintained principally
from Southampton and Weymouth, and there are regular
steamship services from Granville and St Malo on the French
coast. The Jersey railway runs west from St Helier round St
Aubin&rsquo;s Bay to St Aubin, and continues to Corbière at the south-western
extremity of the island; and the Jersey eastern railway
follows the southern and eastern coasts to Gorey. The island is
intersected with a network of good roads.</p>

<p>Jersey is under a distinct and in several respects different form
of administrative government from Guernsey and the smaller
islands included in the bailiwick of Guernsey. For its peculiar
constitution, system of justice, ecclesiastical arrangements and
finance, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Channel Islands</a></span>. There are twelve parishes,
namely St Helier, Grouville, St Brelade, St Clement, St John,
St Laurence, St Martin, St Mary, St Ouen, St Peter, St Saviour
and Trinity. The population of the island nearly doubled
between 1821 and 1901, but decreased from 54,518 to 52,576
between 1891 and 1901.</p>

<p>The history of Jersey is treated under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Channel Islands</a></span>.
Among objects of antiquarian interest, a cromlech near Mont
Orgueil is the finest of several examples. St Brelade&rsquo;s church,
probably the oldest in the island, dates from the 12th century;
among the later churches St Helier&rsquo;s, of the 14th century, may
be mentioned. There are also some very early chapels, considered
to date from the 10th century or earlier; among these
may be noted the Chapelle-ès-Pêcheurs at St Brelade&rsquo;s, and the
picturesque chapel in the grounds of the manor of Rozel. The
castle of Mont Orgueil, of which there are considerable remains,
is believed to be founded upon the site of a Roman stronghold,
and a &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s fort&rdquo; still forms a part of it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERSEY CITY,<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Hudson county,
New Jersey, U.S.A., on a peninsula between the Hudson and
Hackensack rivers at the N. and between New York and Newark
bays at the S., opposite lower Manhattan Island. Pop. (1890),
163,003; (1900), 206,433, of whom 58,424 were foreign-born
(19,314 Irish, 17,375 German, 4642 English, 3832 Italian, 1694
Russian, 1690 Scottish, 1643 Russian Poles, 1445 Austrian) and
3704 were negroes; (1910 census) 267,779. It is the eastern
terminus of the Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley, the West Shore,
the Central of New Jersey, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, the Northern
of New Jersey (operated by the Erie), the Erie, the New York,
Susquehanna &amp; Western, and the New Jersey &amp; New York
(controlled by the Erie) railways, the first three using the
Pennsylvania station; and of the little-used Morris canal.
Jersey City is served by several inter-urban electric railways and
by the tunnels of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan railroad company to
Dey St. and to 33rd St. and 6th Ave., New York City, and it also
has docks of several lines of Transatlantic and coast steamers.
The city occupies a land area of 14.3 sq. m. and has a water-front
of about 12 m. Bergen Hill, a southerly extension of the Palisades,
extends longitudinally through it from north to south.
At the north end this hill rises on the east side precipitously
to a height of nearly 200 ft.; on the west and south sides
the slope is gradual. On the crest of the hill is the fine
Hudson County Boulevard, about 19 m. long and 100 ft.
wide, extending through the city and county from north
to south and passing through West Side Park, a splendid
county park containing lakes and a 70-acre playground. The
water-front, especially on the east side, is given up to manufacturing
and shipping establishments. In the hill section
are the better residences, most of which are wooden and
detached.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal buildings are the city hall and the court house.
There are nine small city parks with an aggregate area of 39.1 acres.
The city has a public library containing (1907) 107,600 volumes
and an historical museum. At the corner of Bergen Ave. and
Forrest St. is the People&rsquo;s Palace, given in 1904 by Joseph Milbank to
the First Congregational church and containing a library and reading-room,
a gymnasium, bowling alleys, a billiard-room, a rifle-range,
a roof-garden, and an auditorium and theatre; kindergarten classes
are held and an employment bureau is maintained. Among the
educational institutions are the German American school, Hasbrouck
institute, St Aloysius academy (Roman Catholic) and St
Peter&rsquo;s college (Roman Catholic); and there are good public schools.
Grain is shipped to and from Jersey City in large quantities, and in
general the city is an important shipping port; being included,
however, in the port of New York, no separate statistics are available.
There are large slaughtering establishments, and factories
for the refining of sugar and for the manufacture of tobacco goods,
soap and perfumery, lead pencils, iron and steel, railway cars,
chemicals, rubber goods, silk goods, dressed lumber, and malt
liquors. The value of the city&rsquo;s manufactured products increased
from $37,376,322 in 1890 to $77,225,116 in 1900, or 106.6%; in
1905 the factory product alone was valued at $75,740,934, an
increase of only 3.9% over the factory product in 1900, this small
rate of increase being due very largely to a decline in the value of
the products of the sugar and molasses refining industry. The
value of the wholesale slaughtering and meat-packing product
decreased from $18,551,783 in 1880 and $11,356,511 in 1890 to
$6,243,217 in 1900&mdash;of this $5,708,763 represented wholesale
slaughtering alone; in 1905 the wholesale slaughtering product was
valued at $7,568,739.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1908 the assessed valuation of the city was $267,039,754.
The city is governed by a board of aldermen and a mayor (elected
biennially), who appoints most of the officials, the street and
water board being the principal exception.</p>

<p>Jersey City when first incorporated was a small sandy peninsula
(an island at high tide) known as Paulus Hook, directly
opposite the lower end of Manhattan Island. It had been a part
of the Dutch patroonship of Pavonia granted to Michael Pauw
in 1630. In 1633 the first buildings were erected, and for more
than a century the Hook was occupied by a small agricultural
and trading community. In 1764 a new post route between
New York and Philadelphia passed through what is now the city,
and direct ferry communication began with New York. Early
in the War of Independence Paulus Hook was fortified by the
Americans, but soon after the battle of Long Island they abandoned
it, and on the 23rd of September 1776 it was occupied by
the British. On the morning of the 19th of August 1779 the
British garrison was surprised by Major Henry Lee (&ldquo;Light
Horse Harry&rdquo;), who with about 500 men took 159 prisoners and
lost only 2 killed and 3 wounded, one of the most brilliant exploits
during the War of Independence. In 1804 Paulus Hook,
containing 117 acres and having about 15 inhabitants, passed
into the possession of three enterprising New York lawyers, who
laid it out as a town and formed an association for its government,
which was incorporated as the &ldquo;associates of the Jersey company.&rdquo;
In 1820 the town was incorporated as the City of Jersey,
but it remained a part of the township of Bergen until 1838, when
it was reincorporated as a distinct municipality. In 1851 the
township of Van Vorst, founded in 1804 between Paulus Hook
and Hoboken, was annexed. In 1870 there were two annexations:
to the south, the town of Bergen, the county-seat, which
was founded in 1660; to the north-west, Hudson City, which
had been separated from the township of North Bergen in 1852
and incorporated as a city in 1855. The town of Greenville, to
the south, was annexed in 1873.</p>

in Egypt, written by an early ruler of Jerusalem,
show that the name existed under the form <i>Urusalim</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;City of Salim&rdquo; or &ldquo;City of Peace,&rdquo; many years before the
Israelites under Joshua entered Canaan. The emperor Hadrian,
when he rebuilt the city, changed the name to Aelia Capitolina.
The Arabs usually designate Jerusalem by names expressive of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Natural Topography.</i>&mdash;Jerusalem is situated in 31° 47&prime; N. and 35°
15&prime; E., in the hill country of southern Palestine, close to the watershed,
at an average altitude of 2500 ft. above the Mediterranean, and 3800
ft. above the level of the Dead Sea. The city stands on a rocky
plateau, which projects southwards from the main line of hills. On
the east the valley of the Kidron separates this plateau from the
ridge of the Mount of Olives, which is 100 to 200 ft. higher, while the
Wadi Er Rababi bounds Jerusalem on the west and south, meeting the
Valley of Kidron near the lower pool of Siloam. Both valleys fall
rapidly as they approach the point of junction, which lies at a depth
of more than 600 ft. below the general valley of the plateau. The
latter, which covers an area of about 1000 acres, has at the present
time a fairly uniform surface and slopes gradually from the north to
the south and east. Originally, however, its formation was very
different, as it was intersected by a deep valley, called Tyropoeon
by Josephus, which, starting from a point N.W. of the Damascus
gate, followed a course first south-east and then west of south,
and joined the two main valleys of Kidron and Er Rababi at Siloam.
Another shorter valley began near the present Jaffa gate and,
taking an easterly direction, joined the Tyropoeon; while a third
ravine passed across what is now the northern part of the Haram
enclosure and fell into the valley of the Kidron. The exact form of
these three interior valleys, which had an important influence on
the construction and history of the city, is still imperfectly known,
as they are to a great extent obliterated by vast accumulations of
rubbish, which has filled them up in some places to a depth of more
than 100 ft. Their approximate form was only arrived at by excavations
made during the later years of the 19th century. The limited
knowledge which we possess of the original features of the ground
within the area of the city makes a reconstruction of the topographical
history of the latter a difficult task; and, as a natural result,
many irreconcilable theories have been suggested. The difficulty
is increased by the fact that the geographical descriptions given in
the Old Testament the Apocrypha and the writings of Josephus
are very short, and, having been written for those who were
acquainted with the places, convey insufficient information to historians
of the present day, when the sites are so greatly altered. All
that can be done is to form a continuous account in accord with the
ancient histories, and with the original formation of the ground,
so far as this has been identified by modern exploration. But the
progress of exploration and excavation may render this subject to
further modification.</p>

<p>The geological formation of the plateau consists of thin beds of
hard silicious chalk, locally called <i>misse</i>, which overlie a thick bed of
soft white limestone, known by the name of <i>meleke</i>. Both descriptions
of rock yielded good material for building; while in the soft
<i>meleke</i> tanks, underground chambers, tombs, &amp;c., were easily
excavated. In ancient times a brook flowed down the valley of the
Kidron, and it is possible that a stream flowed also through the
Tyropoeon valley. The only known spring existing at present
within the limits of the city is the &ldquo;fountain of the Virgin,&rdquo; on
the western side of the Kidron valley, but there may have been
others which are now concealed by the accumulations of rubbish.
Cisterns were also used for the storage of rain water, and aqueducts,
of which the remains still exist (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aqueducts</a></span> <i>ad init.</i>), were
constructed for the conveyance of water from a distance. Speaking
generally, it is probable that the water supply of Jerusalem in ancient
times was better than it is at present.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The early history of Jerusalem is very obscure. The
Tell el-Amarna letters show that, long before the invasion by
Joshua, it was occupied by the Egyptians, and was probably
a stronghold of considerable importance, as it formed a good
strategical position in the hill country of southern Palestine.
We do not know how the Egyptians were forced to abandon
Jerusalem; but, at the time of the Israelite conquest, it was
undoubtedly in the hands of the Jebusites, the native inhabitants
of the country. The exact position of the Jebusite city is unknown;
some authorities locate it on the western hill, now known
as Zion; some on the eastern hill, afterwards occupied by the
Temple and the city of David; while others consider it was a
double settlement, one part being on the western, and the other
on the eastern hill, separated from one another by the Tyropoeon
valley. The latter view appears to be the most probable, as,
according to the Biblical accounts, Jerusalem was partly in Judah
and partly in Benjamin, the line of demarcation between the two
tribes passing through the city. According to <span class="correction" title="amended from his">this</span> theory, the
part of Jerusalem known as Jebus was situated on the western
hill, and the outlying fort of Zion on the eastern hill. The men
of Judah and Benjamin did not succeed in getting full possession
of the place, and the Jebusites still held it when David became
king of Israel. Some years after his accession David succeeded
after some difficulty in taking Jerusalem. He established his
royal city on the eastern hill close to the site of the Jebusite Zion,
while Jebus, the town on the western side of the Tyropoeon
valley, became the civil city, of which Joab, David&rsquo;s leading
general, was appointed governor. David surrounded the royal
city with a wall and built a citadel, probably on the site of the
Jebusite fort of Zion, while Joab fortified the western town.
North of the city of David, the king, acting under divine guidance,
chose a site for the Temple of Jehovah, which was erected
with great magnificence by Solomon. The actual site occupied
by this building has given rise to much controversy, though all
authorities are agreed that it must have stood on some part of
the area now known as the Haram. James Fergusson was of
opinion that the Temple stood near the south-western corner.
As, however, it was proved by the explorations of Sir Charles
Warren in 1869-1870 that the Tyropoeon valley passed under this
corner, and that the foundations must have been of enormous
depth, Fergusson&rsquo;s theory must be regarded as untenable (see
also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sepulchre, Holy</a></span>). On the whole it is most likely that
the Temple was erected by Solomon on the same spot as is now
occupied by the Dome of the Rock, commonly known as the
Mosque of Omar, and, regard being had to the levels of the
ground, it is possible that the Holy of Holies, the most sacred
chamber of the Temple, stood over the rock which is still regarded
with veneration by the Mahommedans. Solomon greatly
strengthened the fortifications of Jerusalem, and was probably
the builder of the line of defence, called by Josephus the first or
old wall, which united the cities on the eastern and western hills.
The kingdom reached its highest point of importance during the
reign of Solomon, but, shortly after his death, it was broken up
by the rebellion of Jeroboam, who founded the separate kingdom
of Israel with its capital at Shechem. Two tribes only, Judah
and Benjamin, with the descendants of Levi, remained faithful
to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. Jerusalem thus lost much
of its importance, especially after it was forced to surrender to
Shishak, king of Egypt, who carried off a great part of the riches
which had been accumulated by Solomon. The history of
Jerusalem during the succeeding three centuries consists for the
most part of a succession of wars against the kingdom of Israel,
the Moabites and the Syrians. Joash, king of Israel, captured
the city from Amaziah, king of Judah, and destroyed part of the
fortifications, but these were rebuilt by Uzziah, the son of
Amaziah, who did much to restore the city to its original prosperity.
In the reign of Hezekiah, the kingdom of Judah became
tributary to the Assyrians, who attempted the capture of
Jerusalem. Hezekiah improved the defences and arranged for
a good water supply, preparatory to the siege by Sennacherib,
the Assyrian general. The siege failed and the Assyrians retired.
Some years later Syria was again invaded by the Egyptians, who
reduced Judah to the position of a tributary state. In the reign
of Zedekiah, the last of the line of kings, Jerusalem was captured
by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, who pillaged the city,
destroyed the Temple, and ruined the fortifications (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jews</a></span>,
§ 17). A number of the principal inhabitants were carried
captive to Babylon, and Jerusalem was reduced to the position
of an insignificant town. Nebuchadrezzar placed in the city a
garrison which appears to have been quartered on the western
hill, while the eastern hill on which were the Temple and the city
of David was left more or less desolate. We have no information
regarding Jerusalem during the period of the captivity, but
fortunately Nehemiah, who was permitted to return and rebuild
the defences about 445 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, has given a fairly clear description
of the line of the wall which enables us to obtain a good idea of
the extent of the city at this period. The Temple had already
been partially rebuilt by Zedekiah and his companions, but on
a scale far inferior to the magnificent building of King Solomon,
and Nehemiah devoted his attention to the reconstruction of the
walls. Before beginning the work, he made a preliminary reconnaissance
of the fortifications on the south of the town from the
Valley Gate, which was near the S.E. corner, to the pool of
Siloam and valley of the Kidron. He then allotted the reconstruction
of wall and gates to different parties of workmen, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
his narrative describes the portion of wall upon which each of
these was employed.<a name="fa1t" id="fa1t" href="#ft1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is clear from his account that the lines of fortifications included
both the eastern and western hills. North of the Temple enclosure
there was a gate, known as the Sheep Gate, which must have opened
into the third valley mentioned above, and stood somewhere near
what is now the north side of the Haram enclosure, but considerably
south of the present north wall of the latter. To the west of the
Sheep Gate there were two important towers in the wall, called respectively
Meah and Hananeel. The tower Hananeel is specially worthy
of notice as it stood N.W. of the Temple and probably formed the
basis of the citadel built by Simon Maccabaeus, which again was
succeeded by the fortress of Antonia, constructed by Herod the Great,
and one of the most important positions at the time of the siege by
Titus. At or near the tower Hananeel the wall turned south along
the east side of the Tyropoeon valley, and then again westward,
crossing the valley at a point probably near the remarkable construction
known as Wilson&rsquo;s arch. A gate in the valley, known as the
Fish Gate, opened on a road which, leading from the north, went
down the Tyropoeon valley to the southern part of the city. Westward
of this gate the wall followed the south side of the valley which
joined the Tyropoeon from the west as far as the north-western
corner of the city at the site of the present Jaffa Gate and the so-called
tower of David. In this part of the wall there were apparently
two gates facing north, <i>i.e.</i> the Old Gate and the Gate of Ephraim,
400 cubits from the corner.<a name="fa2t" id="fa2t" href="#ft2t"><span class="sp">2</span></a> At the corner stood the residence of
the Babylonian governor, near the site upon which King Herod
afterwards built his magnificent palace. From the corner at the
governor&rsquo;s house, the wall went in a southerly direction and turned
south-east to the Valley Gate, remains of which were discovered
by F. J. Bliss and fully described in his <i>Excavations in Jerusalem in
1894-1897</i>. From the Valley Gate the wall took an easterly course
for a distance of 1000 cubits to the Dung Gate, near which on the
east was the Fountain Gate, not far from the lower pool of Siloam.
Here was the most southerly point of Jerusalem, and the wall turning
hence to the north followed the west side of the valley of the Kidron,
enclosing the city of David and the Temple enclosure, and finally
turning west at some point near the site of the Golden Gate joined
the wall, already described, at the Sheep Gate. Nehemiah mentions
a number of places on the eastern hill, including the tomb of David,
the positions of which cannot with our present knowledge be fixed
with any certainty.</p>
</div>

<p>After the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem by Nehemiah,
a considerable number of Jews returned to the city, but we know
practically nothing of its history for more than a century until,
in 332 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, Alexander the Great conquered Syria. The gates of
Jerusalem were opened to him and he left the Jews in peaceful
occupation. But his successors did not act with similar leniency;
when the city was captured by Ptolemy I., king of Egypt, twelve
years later, the fortifications were partially demolished and
apparently not again restored until the period of the high priest
Simon II., who repaired the defences and also the Temple buildings.
In 168 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Antiochus Epiphanes captured Jerusalem,
destroyed the walls, and devastated the Temple, reducing the
city to a worse position than it had occupied since the time of the
captivity. He built a citadel called the Acra to dominate the
town and placed in it a strong garrison of Greeks. The position
of the Acra is doubtful, but it appears most probable that it
stood on the eastern hill between the Temple and the city of
David, both of which it commanded. Some writers place it
north of the Temple on the site afterwards occupied by the
fortress of Antonia, but such a position is not in accord with the
descriptions either in Josephus or in the books of the Maccabees,
which are quite consistent with each other. Other writers again
have placed the Acra on the eastern side of the hill upon which
the church of the Holy Sepulchre now stands, but as this point
was probably quite outside the city at the time of Antiochus
Epiphanes, and is at too great a distance from the Temple, it
can hardly be accepted. But the site which has been already
indicated at the N.E. corner of the present Mosque el Aksa meets
the accounts of the ancient authorities better than any other.
At this point in the Haram enclosure there is an enormous underground
cistern, known as the Great Sea, and this may possibly
have been the source of water supply for the Greek garrison.
The oppression of Antiochus led to a revolt of the Jews under the
leadership of the Maccabees, and Judas Maccabaeus succeeded
in capturing Jerusalem after severe fighting, but could not get
possession of the Acra, which caused much trouble to the Jews,
who erected a wall between it and the Temple, and another wall
to cut it off from the city. The Greeks held out for a considerable
time, but had finally to surrender, probably from want of
food, to Simon Maccabaeus, who demolished the Acra and cut
down the hill upon which it stood so that it might no longer be
higher than the Temple, and that there should be no separation
between the latter and the city. Simon then constructed a new
citadel, north of the Temple, to take the place of the Acra, and
established in Judaea the Asmonean dynasty, which lasted for
nearly a century, when the Roman republic began to make its
influence felt in Syria. In 65 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Jerusalem was captured by
Pompey after a difficult siege. The Asmonean dynasty lasted
a few years longer, but finally came to an end when Herod the
Great, with the aid of the Romans, took possession of Jerusalem
and became the first king of the Idumaean dynasty. Herod
again raised the city to the position of an important capital,
restoring the fortifications, and rebuilding the Temple from its
foundations. He also built the great fortress of Antonia, N.W.
of the Temple, on the site of the citadel of the Asmoneans, and
constructed a magnificent palace for himself on the western hill,
defended by three great towers, which he named Mariamne,
Hippicus and Phasaelus. At some period between the time of
the Maccabees and of Herod, a second or outer wall had been
built outside and north of the first wall, but it is not possible
to fix an accurate date to this line of defence, as the references
to it in Josephus are obscure. Herod adorned the town with
other buildings and constructed a theatre and gymnasium. He
doubled the area of the enclosure round the Temple, and there
can be little doubt that a great part of the walls of the Haram
area date from the time of Herod, while probably the tower of
David, which still exists near the Jaffa Gate, is on the same foundation
as one of the towers adjoining his palace. Archelaus,
Herod&rsquo;s successor, had far less authority than Herod, and the
real power of government at Jerusalem was assumed by the
Roman procurators, in the time of one of whom, Pontius Pilate,
Jesus Christ was condemned to death and crucified outside
Jerusalem. The places of his execution and burial are not
certainly known (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sepulchre, Holy</a></span>).</p>

<p>Herod Agrippa, who succeeded to the kingdom, built a third
or outer wall on the north side of Jerusalem in order to enclose
and defend the buildings which had gradually been constructed
outside the old fortifications. The exact line of this third wall
is not known with certainty, but it probably followed approximately
the same line as the existing north wall of Jerusalem.
Some writers have considered that it extended a considerable
distance farther to the north, but of this there is no proof, and
no remains have as yet been found which would support the
opinion. The wall of Herod Agrippa was planned on a grand
scale, but its execution was stopped by the Romans, so that it
was not completed at the time of the siege of Jerusalem by Titus.
The writings of Josephus give a good idea of the fortifications
and buildings of Jerusalem at the time of the siege, and his
accurate personal knowledge makes his account worthy of the
most careful perusal. He explains clearly how Titus, beginning
his attack from the north, captured the third or outer wall, then
the second wall, and finally the fortress of Antonia, the Temple,
and the upper city. After the capture, Titus ordered the Temple
to be demolished and the fortifications to be levelled, with the
exception of the three great towers at Herod&rsquo;s palace. It is,
however, uncertain how far the order was carried out, and it is
probable that the outer walls of the Temple enclosure were left
partially standing and that the defences on the west and south
of the city were not completely levelled. When Titus and his
army withdrew from Jerusalem, the 10th legion was left as a
permanent Roman garrison, and a fortified camp for their
occupation was established on the western hill. We have no
account of the size or position of this camp, but a consideration
of the site, and a comparison with other Roman camps in various
parts of Europe, make it probable that it occupied an area of
about 50 acres, extending over what is now known as the Armenian
quarter of the town, and that it was bounded on the north by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
old or first wall, on the west also by the old wall, on the south by
a line of defence somewhat in the same position as the present
south wall where it passes the Zion Gate, and on the east by an
entrenchment running north and south parallel to the existing
thoroughfare known as David Street. For sixty years the
Roman garrison were left in undisturbed occupation, but in 132
the Jews rose in revolt under the leadership of Bar-Cochebas or
Barcochba, and took possession of Jerusalem. After a severe
struggle, the revolt was suppressed by the Roman general, Julius
Severus, and Jerusalem was recaptured and again destroyed.
According to some writers, this devastation was even more complete
than after the siege by Titus. About 130 the emperor
Hadrian decided to rebuild Jerusalem, and make it a Roman
colony. The new city was called Aelia Capitolina. The exact
size of the city is not known, but it probably extended as far as
the present north wall of Jerusalem and included the northern
part of the western hill. A temple dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus
was erected on the site of the Temple, and other buildings
were constructed, known as the Theatre, the Demosia, the
Tetranymphon, the Dodecapylon and the Codra. The Jews
were forbidden to reside in the city, but Christians were freely
admitted. The history of Jerusalem during the period between
the foundation of the city of Aelia by the emperor Hadrian and
the accession of Constantine the Great in 306 is obscure, but no
important change appears to have been made in the size or
fortifications of the city, which continued as a Roman colony.
In 326 Constantine, after his conversion to Christianity, issued
orders to the bishop Macarius to recover the site of the crucifixion
of Jesus Christ, and the tomb in which his body was laid
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sepulchre, Holy</a></span>). After the holy sites had been determined,
Constantine gave orders for the construction of two
magnificent churches, the one over the tomb and the other over
the place where the cross was discovered. The present church
of the Holy Sepulchre stands on the site upon which one of the
churches of Constantine was built, but the second church, the
Basilica of the Cross, has completely disappeared. The next
important epoch in building construction at Jerusalem was about
460, when the empress Eudocia visited Palestine and expended
large sums oh the improvement of the city. The walls were
repaired by her orders, and the line of fortifications appears to
have been extended on the south so as to include the pool of
Siloam. A church was built above the pool, probably at the
same time, and, after having completely disappeared for many
centuries, it was recovered by F. J. Bliss when making his
exploration of Jerusalem. The empress also erected a large church
in honour of St Stephen north of the Damascus Gate, and is
believed to have been buried therein. The site of this church was
discovered in 1874, and it has since been rebuilt. In the 6th
century the emperor Justinian erected a magnificent basilica
at Jerusalem, in honour of the Virgin Mary, and attached to it
two hospitals, one for the reception of pilgrims and one for the
accommodation of the sick poor. The description given by
Procopius does not indicate clearly where this church was
situated. A theory frequently put forward is that it stood
within the Haram area near the Mosque of el Aksa, but it is more
probable that it was on Zion, near the traditional place of the
Coenaculum or last supper, where the Mahommedan building
known as the tomb of David now stands. In 614 Chosroes II.,
the king of Persia, captured Jerusalem, devastated many of the
buildings, and massacred a great number of the inhabitants.
The churches at the Holy Sepulchre were much damaged, but
were partially restored by the monk Modestus, who devoted
himself with great energy to the work. After a severe struggle
the Persians were defeated by the emperor Heraclius, who entered
Jerusalem in triumph in 629 bringing with him the holy cross,
which had been carried off by Chosroes. At this period the
religion of Mahomet was spreading over the east, and in 637 the
caliph Omar marched on Jerusalem, which capitulated after a
siege of four months. Omar behaved with great moderation,
restraining his troops from pillage and leaving the Christians in
possession of their churches. A wooden mosque was erected
near the site of the Temple, which was replaced by the Mosque
of Aksa, built by the amir Abdalmalik (Abd el Malek), who also
constructed the Dome of the Rock, known as the Mosque of
Omar, in 688. The Mahommedans held Jerusalem until 1099,
when it was captured by the crusaders under Godfrey of Bouillon,
and became the capital of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crusades</a></span>, vol. viii. p. 401) until 1187, when Saladin reconquered
it, and rebuilt the walls. Since that time, except
from 1229 to 1239, and from 1243 to 1244, the city has been
held by the Mahommedans. It was occupied by the Egyptian
sultans until 1517, when the Turks under Selim I. occupied
Syria. Selim&rsquo;s successor, Suleiman the Magnificent, restored the
fortifications, which since that time have been little altered.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Modern Jerusalem.</i>&mdash;Jerusalem is the chief town of a sanjak,
governed by a <i>mutessarif</i>, who reports directly to the Porte. It has
the usual executive and town councils, upon which the recognized
religious communities, or <i>millets</i>, have representatives; and it is
garrisoned by infantry of the V. army corps. The city is connected
with its port, Jaffa, by a carriage road, 41 m., and by a metre-gauge
railway, 54 m., which was completed in 1892, and is worked by a
French company. There are also carriage roads to Bethlehem,
Hebron and Jericho, and a road to Nablus was in course of construction
in 1909. Prior to 1858, when the modern building period commenced,
Jerusalem lay wholly within its 16th-century walls, and even
as late as 1875 there were few private residences beyond their limits.
At present Jerusalem without the walls covers a larger area than that
within them. The growth has been chiefly towards the north and
north-west; but there are large suburbs on the west, and on the south-west
near the railway station on the plain of Rephaim. The village
of Siloam has also increased in size, and the western slopes of Olivet
are being covered with churches, monasteries and houses. Amongst
the most marked features of the change that has taken place since
1875 are the growth of religious and philanthropic establishments;
the settlement of Jewish colonies from Bokhara, Yemen and Europe;
the migration of Europeans, old Moslem families, and Jews from the
city to the suburbs; the increased vegetation, due to the numerous
gardens and improved methods of cultivation; the substitution of
timber and red tiles for the vaulted stone roofs which were so
characteristic of the old city; the striking want of beauty, grandeur,
and harmony with their environment exhibited by most of the new
buildings; and the introduction of wheeled transport, which, cutting
into the soft limestone, has produced mud and dust to an extent
previously unknown. To facilitate communication between the
city and its suburbs, the Bab ez-Z&#257;hire, or Herod&rsquo;s Gate, and a new
gate, near the north-west angle of the walls, have been opened;
and a portion of the wall, adjoining the Jaffa Gate, has been thrown
down, to allow free access for carriages. Within the city the principal
streets have been roughly paved, and iron bars placed across
the narrow alleys to prevent the passage of camels. Without the
walls carriage roads have been made to the mount of Olives, the
railway station, and various parts of the suburbs, but they are kept
in bad repair. Little effort has been made to meet the increased
sanitary requirements of the larger population and wider inhabited
area. There is no municipal water-supply, and the main drain of
the city discharges into the lower pool of Siloam, which has become
an open cesspit. In several places the débris within the walls is
saturated with sewage, and the water of the Fountain of the
Virgin, and of many of the old cisterns, is unfit for drinking. Amongst
the more important buildings for ecclesiastical and philanthropic
purposes erected to the north of the city since 1860 are the Russian
cathedral, hospice and hospital; the French hospital of St Louis,
and hospice and church of St Augustine; the German schools,
orphanages and hospitals; the new hospital and industrial school of
the London mission to the Jews; the Abyssinian church; the church
and schools of the Church missionary society; the Anglican church,
college and bishop&rsquo;s house; the Dominican monastery, seminary
and church of St Stephen; the Rothschild hospital and girls&rsquo; school;
and the industrial school and workshops of the Alliance Israélite.
On the mount of Olives are the Russian church, tower and hospice,
near the chapel of the Ascension; the French Paternoster church;
the Carmelite nunnery; and the Russian church of St Mary Magdalene,
near Gethsemane. South of the city are the Armenian
monastery of Mount Zion and Bishop Gobat&rsquo;s school. On the west
side are the institution of the sisters of St Vincent; the Ratisbon
school; the Montefiore hospice; the British ophthalmic hospital of
the knights of St John; the convent and church of the Clarisses;
and the Moravian leper hospital. Within the city walls are the
Latin Patriarchal church and residence; the school of the Frères
de la Doctrine Chrétienne; the schools and printing house of the
Franciscans; the Coptic monastery; the German church of the
Redeemer, and hospice; the United Armenian church of the Spasm;
the convent and school of the S&oelig;urs de Zion; the Austrian hospice;
the Turkish school and museum; the monastery and seminary of
the Frères de la Mission Algérienne, with the restored church of St
Anne, the church, schools and hospital of the London mission to

The climate is naturally good, but continued neglect of sanitary
precautions has made the city unhealthy. During the summer
months the heat is tempered by a fresh sea-breeze, and there is
usually a sharp fall of temperature at night; but in spring and
autumn the east and south-east winds, which blow across the heated
depression of the Ghor, are enervating and oppressive. A dry
season, which lasts from May to October, is followed by a rainy
season, divided into the early winter and latter rains. Snow falls
two years out of three, but soon melts. The mean annual temperature
is 62.8° F., the maximum 112°, and the minimum 25°. The
mean monthly temperature is lowest (47.2°) in February, and highest
(76.3°) in August. The mean annual rainfall (1861 to 1899) is
26.06 in. The most unhealthy period is from 1st May to 31st
October, when there are, from time to time, outbreaks of typhoid,
small-pox, diphtheria and other epidemics. The unhealthiness of
the city is chiefly due to want of proper drainage, impure drinking-water,
miasma from the disturbed rubbish heaps, and contaminated
dust from the uncleansed roads and streets. The only industry
is the manufacture of olive-wood and mother-of-pearl goods for
sale to pilgrims and for export. The imports (see Joppa) are chiefly
food, clothing and building material. The population in 1905 was
about 60,000 (Moslems 7000, Christians 13,000, Jews 40,000). During
the pilgrimage season it is increased by about 15,000 travellers and
pilgrims.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JERUSALEM, SYNOD OF<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> (1672). By far the most important
of the many synods held at Jerusalem (see Wetzer and Welte,
<i>Kirchenlexikon</i>, 2nd ed., vi. 1357 sqq.) is that of 1672; and its
confession is the most vital statement of faith made in the Greek
Church during the past thousand years. It refutes article by
article the confession of Cyril Lucaris, which appeared in Latin
at Geneva in 1629, and in Greek, with the addition of four
&ldquo;questions,&rdquo; in 1633. Lucaris, who died in 1638 as patriarch
of Constantinople, had corresponded with Western scholars and
had imbibed Calvinistic views. The great opposition which
arose during his lifetime continued after his death, and found
classic expression in the highly venerated confession of Petrus
Mogilas, metropolitan of Kiev (1643). Though this was intended
as a barrier against Calvinistic influences, certain Reformed
writers, as well as Roman Catholics, persisted in claiming the
support of the Greek Church for sundry of their own positions.
Against the Calvinists the synod of 1672 therefore aimed its
rejection of unconditional predestination and of justification by
faith alone, also its advocacy of what are substantially the
Roman doctrines of transubstantiation and of purgatory; the
Oriental hostility to Calvinism had been fanned by the Jesuits.
Against the Church of Rome, however, there was directed the
affirmation that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and
not from both Father and Son; this rejection of the <i>filioque</i> was
not unwelcome to the Turks. Curiously enough, the synod refused
to believe that the heretical confession it refuted was
actually by a former patriarch of Constantinople; yet the proofs
of its genuineness seem to most scholars overwhelming. In
negotiations between Anglican and Russian churchmen the confession
of Dositheus<a name="fa1u" id="fa1u" href="#ft1u"><span class="sp">1</span></a> usually comes to the front.</p>

Italy, in the province of Ancona, from which it is 17 m. W. by S.
by rail, 318 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901), 23,285. The place
took its ancient name from the river Aesis (mod. Esino), upon the
left bank of which it lies. It still retains its picturesque medieval
town walls. The Palazzo del Comune is a fine, simple, early
Renaissance building (1487-1503) by Francesco di Giorgio
Martini; the walls are of brick and the window and door-frames
of stone, with severely restrained ornamentation. The courtyard
with its loggie was built by Andrea Sansovino in 1519. The
library contains some good pictures by Lorenzo Lotto. The
castle was built by Baccio Pontelli (1488), designer of the castle
at Ostia (1483-1486). Jesi was the birthplace of the emperor
Frederic II. (1194), and also of the musical composer, Giovanni
Battista Pergolesi (1710-1736). The river Aesis formed the
boundary of Italy proper from about 250 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to the time of
Sulla (<i>c.</i> 82 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>); and, in Augustus&rsquo; division of Italy, that
between Umbria (the 6th region) and Picenum (the 5th). The
town itself was a colony, of little importance, except, apparently,
as a recruiting ground for the Roman army.</p>

often regarded as the first in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (cf.
Isa. xi. 1, 10). Hence the phrase &ldquo;tree of Jesse&rdquo; is applied to
a design representing the descent of Jesus from the royal line of
David, formerly a favourite ecclesiastical ornament. From a
recumbent figure of Jesse springs a tree bearing in its branches
the chief figures in the line of descent, and terminating in the
figure of Jesus, or of the Virgin and Child. There are remains of
such a tree in the church of St Mary at Abergavenny, carved in
wood, and supposed to have once stood behind the high altar.
Jesse candelabra were also made. At Laon and Amiens there
are sculptured Jesses over the central west doorways of the
cathedrals. The design was chiefly used in windows. The
great east window at Wells and the window at the west end of
the nave at Chartres are fine examples. There is a 16th-century
Jesse window from Mechlin in St George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square,
London. The Jesse window in the choir of Dorchester Abbey,
Oxfordshire, is remarkable in that the tree forms the central
mullion, and many of the figures are represented as statuettes
on the branches of the upper tracery; other figures are in the
stained glass; the whole gives a beautiful example of the combination
of glass and carved stonework in one design.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JESSE, EDWARD<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1780-1868), English writer on natural
history, was born on the 14th of January 1780, at Hutton Cranswick,
Yorkshire, where his father was vicar of the parish. He
became clerk in a government office in 1798, and for a time was
secretary to Lord Dartmouth, when president of the Board of
Control. In 1812 he was appointed commissioner of hackney
coaches, and later he became deputy surveyor-general of the
royal parks and palaces. On the abolition of this office he
retired on a pension, and he died at Brighton on the 28th of
March 1868.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The result of his interest in the habits and characteristics of
animals was a series of pleasant and popular books on natural
history, the principal of which are <i>Gleanings in Natural History</i>
(1832-1835); <i>An Angler&rsquo;s Rambles</i> (1836); <i>Anecdotes of Dogs</i> (1846);
and <i>Lectures on Natural History</i> (1863). He also edited Izaak
Walton&rsquo;s <i>Compleat Angler</i>, Gilbert White&rsquo;s <i>Selborne</i>, and L. Ritchie&rsquo;s
<i>Windsor Castle</i>, and wrote a number of handbooks to places of
interest, including Windsor and Hampton Court.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JESSE, JOHN HENEAGE<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (1815-1874), English historian,
son of Edward Jesse, was educated at Eton, and afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
became a clerk in the secretary&rsquo;s department of the admiralty.
He died in London on the 7th of July 1874. His poem on Mary
Queen of Scots was published about 1831, and was followed by
a collection of poems entitled <i>Tales of the Dead</i>. He also wrote
a drama, <i>Richard III.</i>, and a fragmentary poem entitled <i>London</i>.
None of these ventures achieved any success, but his numerous
historical works are written with vivacity and interest, and, in
their own style, are an important contribution to the history of
England. They include <i>Memoirs of the Court of England during
the Reign of the Stuarts</i> (1840), <i>Memoirs of the Court of England
from the Revolution of 1688 to the Death of George II.</i> (1843), <i>George
Selwyn and his Contemporaries</i> (1843, new ed. 1882), <i>Memoirs of
the Pretenders and their Adherents</i> (1845), <i>Memoirs of Richard the
Third and his Contemporaries</i> (1861), and <i>Memoirs of the Life and
Reign of King George the Third</i> (1867). The titles of these works
are sufficiently indicative of their character. They are sketches
of the principal personages and of the social details of various
periods in the history of England rather than complete and comprehensive
historical narratives. In addition to these works
Jesse wrote <i>Literary and Historical Memorials of London</i> (1847),
<i>London and its Celebrities</i> (1850), and a new edition of this work as
<i>London: its Celebrated Characters and Remarkable Places</i> (1871).
His <i>Memoirs of Celebrated Etonians</i> appeared in 1875.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JESSEL, SIR GEORGE<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1824-1883), English judge, was born
in London on the 13th of February 1824. He was the son of
Zadok Aaron Jessel, a Jewish coral merchant. George Jessel
was educated at a school for Jews at Kew, and being prevented by
then existing religious disabilities from proceeding to Oxford or
Cambridge, went to University College, London. He entered as a
student at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1842, and a year later took his B.A.
degree at the university of London, becoming M.A. and gold
medallist in mathematics and natural philosophy in 1844. In
1846 he became a fellow of University College, and in 1847 he was
called to the bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. His earnings during his first
three years at the bar were 52, 346, and 795 guineas, from which
it will be seen that his rise to a tolerably large practice was rapid.
His work, however, was mainly conveyancing, and for long his
income remained almost stationary. By degrees, however, he
got more work, and was called within the bar in 1865, becoming a
bencher of his Inn in the same year and practising in the Rolls
Court. Jessel entered parliament as Liberal member for Dover
in 1868, and although neither his intellect nor his oratory was of a
class likely to commend itself to his fellow-members, he attracted
Gladstone&rsquo;s attention by two learned speeches on the Bankruptcy
Bill which was before the house in 1869, with the result that in
1871 he was appointed solicitor-general. His reputation at this
time stood high in the chancery courts; on the common law side he
was unknown, and on the first occasion upon which he came into
the court of Queen&rsquo;s bench to move on behalf of the Crown, there
was very nearly a collision between him and the bench. His forceful
and direct method of bringing his arguments home to the
bench was not modified in his subsequent practice before it. His
great powers were fully recognized; his business in addition to that
on behalf of the Crown became very large, and his income for three
years before he was raised to the bench amounted to nearly
£25,000 per annum. In 1873 Jessel succeeded Lord Romilly as
master of the rolls. From 1873 to 1881 Jessel sat as a judge
of first instance in the rolls court, being also a member of the
court of appeal. In November 1874 the first Judicature Act came
into effect, and in 1881 the Judicature Act of that year made the
master of the rolls the ordinary president of the first court of
appeal, relieving him of his duties as a judge of first instance. In
the court of appeal Jessel presided almost to the day of his
death. For some time before 1883 he suffered from diabetes with
chronic disorder of the heart and liver, but struggled against it;
on the 16th of March 1883 he sat in court for the last time, and
on the 21st of March he died at his residence in London, the
immediate cause of death being cardiac syncope.</p>

<p>As a judge of first instance Jessel was a revelation to those
accustomed to the proverbial slowness of the chancery courts
and of the master of the rolls who preceded him. He disposed of
the business before him with rapidity combined with correctness
of judgment, and he not only had no arrears himself, but was
frequently able to help other judges to clear their lists. His
knowledge of law and equity was wide and accurate, and his
memory for cases and command of the principles laid down in
them extraordinary. In the rolls court he never reserved a
judgment, not even in the Epping Forest case (<i>Commissioners of
Sewers</i> v. <i>Glasse</i>, L.R. 19 Eq.; <i>The Times</i>, 11th November 1874),
in which the evidence and arguments lasted twenty-two days
(150 witnesses being examined in court, while the documents went
back to the days of King John), and in the court of appeal he
did so only twice, and then in deference to the wishes of his
colleagues. The second of these two occasions was the case of
<i>Robarts</i> v. <i>The Corporation of London</i> (49 <i>Law Times</i> 455; <i>The
Times</i>, 10th March 1883), and those who may read Jessel&rsquo;s judgment
should remember that, reviewing as it does the law and custom
on the subject, and the records of the city with regard to the
appointment of a remembrancer from the 16th century, together
with the facts of the case before the court, it occupied nearly
an hour to deliver, but was nevertheless delivered without notes&mdash;this,
too, on the 9th of March 1883, when the judge who uttered
it was within a fortnight of his death. Never during the 19th
century was the business of any court performed so rapidly,
punctually, and satisfactorily as it was when Jessel presided.
He was master of the rolls at a momentous period of legal history.
The Judicature Acts, completing the fusion of law and equity,
were passed while he was judge of first instance, and were still new
to the courts when he died. His knowledge and power of assimilating
knowledge of all subjects, his mastery of every branch of
law with which he had to concern himself, as well as of equity,
together with his willingness to give effect to the new system,
caused it to be said when he died that the success of the Judicature
Acts would have been impossible without him. His
faults as a judge lay in his disposition to be intolerant of those
who, not able to follow the rapidity of his judgment, endeavoured
to persist in argument after he had made up his mind; but
though he was peremptory with the most eminent counsel, young
men had no cause to complain of his treatment of them.</p>

<p>Jessel sat on the royal commission for the amendment of the
Medical Acts, taking an active part in the preparation of its
report. He actively interested himself in the management of London
University, of which he was a fellow from 1861, and of which
he was elected vice-chancellor in 1880. He was one of the
commissioners of patents, and trustee of the British Museum.
He was also chairman of the committee of judges which drafted
the new rules rendered necessary by the Judicature Acts. He
was treasurer of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn in 1883, and vice-president of the
council of legal education. He was also a fellow of the Royal
Society. Jessel&rsquo;s career marks an epoch on the bench, owing to
the active part taken by him in rendering the Judicature Acts
effective, and also because he was the last judge capable of
sitting in the House of Commons, a privilege of which he did not
avail himself. He was the first Jew who, as solicitor-general,
took a share in the executive government of his country, the
first Jew who was sworn a regular member of the privy council,
and the first Jew who took a seat on the judicial bench of Great
Britain; he was also, for many years after being called to the
bar, so situated that any one might have driven him from it,
because, being a Jew, he was not qualified to be a member of the
bar. In person Jessel was a stoutish, square-built man of
middle height, with dark hair, somewhat heavy features, a fresh
ruddy complexion, and a large mouth. He married in 1856
Amelia, daughter of Joseph Moses, who survived him together
with three daughters and two sons, the elder of whom, Charles
James (b. 1860), was made a baronet shortly after the death
of his distinguished father and in recognition of his services.</p>

division of Bengal. The town is on the Bhairab river,
with a railway station 75 m. N.E. of Calcutta. Pop. (1901), 8054.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span></p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Jessore</span> has an area of 2925 sq. m. Pop.
(1901), 1,813,155, showing a decrease of 4% in the decade. The
district forms the central portion of the delta between the Hugli
and the united Ganges and Brahmaputra. It is a vast alluvial
plain intersected by rivers and watercourses, which in the
southern portion spread out into large marshes. The northern
part is verdant, with extensive groves of date-palms; villages
are numerous and large; and the people are prosperous. In the
central portion the population is sparse, the only part suitable
for dwellings being the high land on the banks of rivers.
The principal rivers are the Madhumati or Haringhata (which
forms the eastern boundary of the district), with its tributaries
the Nabaganga, Chitra, and Bhairab; the Kumar, Kabadak,
Katki, Harihar, Bhadra and Atharabanka. Within the last
century the rivers in the interior of Jessore have ceased to be
true deltaic rivers; and, whereas the northern portion of the
district formerly lay under water for several months every year,
it is now reached only by unusual inundations. The tide
reaches as far north as the latitude of Jessore town. Jessore
is the centre of sugar manufacture from date palms. The exports
are sugar, rice, pulse, timber, honey, shells, &amp;c.; the imports
are salt, English goods, and cloth. The district is crossed by
the Eastern Bengal railway, but the chief means of communication
are waterways.</p>

<p>British administration was completely established in the
district in 1781, when the governor-general ordered the opening
of a court at Murali near Jessore. Before that, however, the
fiscal administration had been in the hands of the English, having
been transferred to the East India company with that of the rest
of Bengal in 1765. The changes in jurisdiction in Jessore have
been very numerous. After many transfers and rectifications,
the district was in 1863 finally constituted as it at present stands.
The rajas of Jessore or Chanchra trace their origin to Bhabeswar
Rai, a soldier in the army of Khan-i-Azam, an imperial general,
who deprived Raja Pratapaditya, the popular hero of the Sundarbans,
of several fiscal divisions, and conferred them on Bhabeswar.
But Manohar Rai (1649-1705) is regarded as the principal
founder of the family. The estate when he inherited it was of
moderate size, but he acquired one <i>pargana</i> after another, until,
at his death, the property was by far the largest in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JESUATI,<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> a religious order founded by Giovanni Colombini of
Siena in 1360. Colombini had been a prosperous merchant and a
senator in his native city, but, coming under ecstatic religious
influences, abandoned secular affairs and his wife and daughter
(after making provision for them), and with a friend of like
temperament, Francesco Miani, gave himself to a life of apostolic
poverty, penitential discipline, hospital service and public
preaching. The name Jesuati was given to Colombini and his
disciples from the habit of calling loudly on the name of Jesus at
the beginning and end of their ecstatic sermons. The senate
banished Colombini from Siena for imparting foolish ideas to the
young men of the city, and he continued his mission in Arezzo
and other places, only to be honourably recalled home on the
outbreak of a devastating pestilence. He went out to meet
Urban V. on his return from Avignon to Rome in 1367, and craved
his sanction for the new order and a distinctive habit. Before
this was granted Colombini had to clear the movement of a suspicion
that it was connected with the heretical sect of Fraticelli,
and he died on the 31st of July 1367, soon after the papal approval
had been given. The guidance of the new order, whose members
(all lay brothers) gave themselves entirely to works of mercy,
devolved upon Miani. Their rule of life, originally a compound
of Benedictine and Franciscan elements, was later modified
on Augustinian lines, but traces of the early penitential idea
persisted, <i>e.g.</i> the wearing of sandals and a daily flagellation.
Paul V. in 1606 arranged for a small proportion of clerical members,
and later in the 17th century the Jesuati became so secularized
that the members were known as the Aquavitae Fathers, and the
order was dissolved by Clement IX. in 1668. The female branch
of the order, the Jesuati sisters, founded by Caterina Colombini
(d. 1387) in Siena, and thence widely dispersed, more consistently
maintained the primitive strictness of the society and survived
the male branch by 200 years, existing until 1872 in small communities
in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JESUITS,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> the name generally given to the members of the
Society of Jesus, a religious order in the Roman Catholic Church,
founded in 1539. This Society may be defined, in its original
conception and well-avowed object, as a body of highly
trained religious men of various degrees, bound by the three
personal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, together with,
in some cases, a special vow to the pope&rsquo;s service, with the object
of labouring for the spiritual good of themselves and their
neighbours. They are declared to be mendicants and enjoy
all the privileges of the other mendicant orders. They are
governed and live by constitutions and rules, mostly drawn up
by their founder, St Ignatius of Loyola, and approved by the
popes. Their proper title is &ldquo;Clerks Regulars of the Society of
Jesus,&rdquo; the word <i>Societas</i> being taken as synonymous with the
original Spanish term, <i>Compañia</i>; perhaps the military term
<i>Cohors</i> might more fully have expressed the original idea of a
band of spiritual soldiers living under martial law and discipline.
The ordinary term &ldquo;Jesuit&rdquo; was given to the Society by its
avowed opponents; it is first found in the writings of Calvin and
in the registers of the Parlement of Paris as early as 1552.</p>

<p><i>Constitution and Character.</i>&mdash;The formation of the Society was
a masterpiece of genius on the part of a man (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Loyola</a></span>) who
was quick to realize the necessity of the moment. Just before
Ignatius was experiencing the call to conversion, Luther had
begun his revolt against the Roman Church by burning the papal
bull of excommunication on the 10th of December 1520. But
while Luther&rsquo;s most formidable opponent was thus being
prepared in Spain, the actual formation of the Society was
not to take place for eighteen years. Its conception seems
to have developed very slowly in the mind of Ignatius.
It introduced a new idea into the Church. Hitherto all
regulars made a point of the choral office in choir. But as
Ignatius conceived the Church to be in a state of war, what was
desirable in days of peace ceased when the life of the cloister
had to be exchanged for the discipline of the camp; so in the
sketch of the new society which he laid before Paul III., Ignatius
laid down the principle that the obligation of the breviary
should be fulfilled privately and separately and not in choir.
The other orders, too, were bound by the idea of a constitutional
monarchy based on the democratic spirit. Not so with
the Society. The founder placed the general for life in an almost
uncontrolled position of authority, giving him the faculty of
dispensing individuals from the decrees of the highest legislative
body, the general congregations. Thus the principle of military
obedience was exalted to a degree higher than that existing in
the older orders, which preserved to their members certain
constitutional rights.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The soldier-mind of Ignatius can be seen throughout the constitutions.
Even in the spiritual labours which the Society shares with
the other orders, its own ways of dealing with persons and things
result from the system of training which succeeds in forming men
to a type that is considered desirable. But it must not be thought
that in practice the rule of the Society and the high degree of obedience
demanded result in mere mechanism. By a system of check
and counter check devised in the constitutions the power of local
superiors is modified, so that in practice the working is smooth.
Ignatius knew that while a high ideal was necessary for every
society, his followers were flesh and blood, not machines. He made
it clear from the first that the Society was everything and the
individual nothing, except so far as he might prove a useful instrument
for carrying out the Society&rsquo;s objects. Ignatius said to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
secretary Polanco that &ldquo;in those who offered themselves he looked
less to purely natural goodness than to firmness of character and
ability for business, for he was of opinion that those who were not
fit for public business were not adapted for filling offices in the
Society.&rdquo; He further declared that even exceptional qualities and
endowments in a candidate were valuable in his eyes only on the
condition of their being brought into play, or held in abeyance,
strictly at the command of a superior. Hence his teaching on
obedience. His letter on this subject, addressed to the Jesuits of
Coimbra in 1553, is still one of the standard formularies of the
Society, ranking with those other products of his pen, the <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i> and the <i>Constitutions</i>. In this letter Ignatius clothes the
general with the powers of a commander-in-chief in time of war,
giving him the absolute disposal of all members of the Society in
every place and for every purpose. He pushes the claim even
further, requiring, besides entire outward submission to command,
also the complete identification of the inferior&rsquo;s will with that of the
superior. He lays down that the superior is to be obeyed simply
as such and as standing in the place of God, without reference to his
personal wisdom, piety or discretion; that any obedience which falls
short of making the superior&rsquo;s will one&rsquo;s own, in inward affection as
well as in outward effect, is lax and imperfect; that going beyond
the letter of command, even in things abstractly good and praiseworthy,
is disobedience, and that the &ldquo;sacrifice of the intellect&rdquo; is
the third and highest grade of obedience, well pleasing to God, when
the inferior not only wills what the superior wills, but thinks what
he thinks, submitting his judgment, so far as it is possible for the
will to influence and lead the judgment. This <i>Letter on Obedience</i>
was written for the guidance and formation of Ignatius&rsquo;s own
followers; it was an entirely domestic affair. But when it became
known beyond the Society the teaching met with great opposition,
especially from members of other orders whose institutes represented
the normal days of peace rather than those of war. The
letter was condemned by the Inquisitions of Spain and Portugal;
and it tasked all the skill and learning of Bellarmine as its apologist,
together with the whole influence of the Society, to avert what seemed
to be a probable condemnation at Rome.</p>

<p>The teaching of the <i>Letter</i> must be understood in the living spirit
of the Society. Ignatius himself lays down the rule that an inferior
is bound to make all necessary representations to his superior so as
to guide him in imposing a precept of obedience. When a superior
knows the views of his inferior and still commands, it is because he
is aware of other sides of the question which appear of greater
importance than those that the inferior has brought forward.
Ignatius distinctly excepts the case where obedience in itself would
be sinful: &ldquo;In all things <i>except sin</i> I ought to do the will of my
superior and not my own.&rdquo; There may be cases where an inferior
judges that what is commanded is sinful. What is to be done?
Ignatius says: &ldquo;When it seems to me that I am commanded by
my superior to do a thing against which my conscience revolts as
sinful and my superior judges otherwise, it is my duty to yield my
doubts to him unless I am otherwise constrained by evident reasons.
... If submissions do not appease my conscience I must impart
my doubts to two or three persons of discretion and abide by their
decision.&rdquo; From this it is clear that only in <i>doubtful</i> cases concerning
sin should an inferior try to submit his judgment to that of his
superior, who <i>ex officio</i> is held to be not only one who would not order
what is clearly sinful, but also a competent judge who knows and
understands, better than the inferior, the nature and aspect of the
command. As the Jesuit obedience is based on the law of God, it is
clearly impossible that he should be bound to obey in what is directly
opposed to the divine service. A Jesuit lives in obedience all his
life, though the yoke is not galling nor always felt. He can accept
no dignity or office which will make him independent of the Society;
and even if ordered by the pope to accept the cardinalate or the
episcopate, he is still bound, if not to obey, yet to listen to the
advice of those whom the general deputes to counsel him in important
matters.</p>

<p>The Jesuits had to find their principal work in the world and in
direct and immediate contact with mankind. To seek spiritual
perfection in a retired life of contemplation and prayer did not seem
to Ignatius to be the best way of reforming the evils which had
brought about the revolt from Rome. He withdrew his followers
from this sort of retirement, except as a mere temporary preparation
for later activity; he made habitual intercourse with the world a
prime duty; and to this end he rigidly suppressed all such external
peculiarities of dress or rule as tended to put obstacles in the way of
his followers acting freely as emissaries, agents or missionaries in
the most various places and circumstances. Another change he
introduced even more completely than did the founders of the
Friars. The Jesuit has no home: the whole world is his parish.
Mobility and cosmopolitanism are of the very essence of the Society.
As Ignatius said, the ancient monastic communities were the
infantry of the Church, whose duty was to stand firmly in one place
on the battlefield; the Jesuits were to be her light horse, capable of
going anywhere at a moment&rsquo;s notice, but especially apt and designed
for scouting and skirmishing. To carry out this view, it
was one of his plans to send foreigners as superiors or officers to the
Jesuit houses in each country, requiring of these envoys, however,
invariably to use the language of their new place of residence and
to study it both in speaking and writing till entire mastery of it
had been acquired&mdash;thus by degrees making all the parts of his
system mutually interchangeable, and so largely increasing the
number of persons eligible to fill any given post without reference
to locality. But subsequent experience has, in practice, modified
this interchange, as far as local government goes, though the central
government of the Society is always cosmopolitan.</p>
</div>

<p>Next we must consider the machinery by which the Society
is constituted and governed so as to make its spirit a living energy
and not a mere abstract theory. The Society is distributed
into six grades: novices, scholastics, temporal coadjutors (lay
brothers), spiritual coadjutors, professed of the three vows,
and professed of the four vows. No one can become a postulant
for admission to the Society until fourteen years old, unless
by special dispensation. The novice is classified according as his
destination is the priesthood or lay brotherhood, while a third
class of &ldquo;indifferents&rdquo; receives such as are reserved for further
inquiry before a decision of this kind is made. The novice has
first to undergo a strict retreat, practically in solitary confinement,
during which he receives from a director the <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i> and makes a general confession of his whole life; after
which the first novitiate of two years&rsquo; duration begins. In this
period of trial the real character of the man is discerned, his
weak points are noted and his will is tested. Prayer and the
practices of asceticism, as means to an end, are the chief occupations
of the novice. He may leave or be dismissed at any
time during the two years; but at the end of the period if he is
approved and destined for the priesthood, he is advanced to
the grade of scholastic and takes the following simple vows in the
presence of certain witnesses, but not to any person:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Almighty Everlasting God, albeit everyway most unworthy in
Thy holy sight, yet relying on Thine infinite kindness and mercy
and impelled by the desire of serving Thee, before the Most Holy
Virgin Mary and all Thy heavenly host, I, N., vow to Thy divine
Majesty Poverty, Chastity and Perpetual Obedience to the Society
of Jesus, and promise that I will enter the same Society to live in it
perpetually, understanding all things according to the Constitutions
of the Society. I humbly pray from Thine immense goodness and
clemency, through the Blood of Jesus Christ, that Thou wilt deign
to accept this sacrifice in the odour of sweetness; and as Thou hast
granted me to desire and to offer this, so wilt Thou bestow abundant
grace to fulfil it.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The scholastic then follows the ordinary course of an undergraduate
at a university. After passing five years in arts he has,
while still keeping up his own studies, to devote five or six years
more to teaching the junior classes in various Jesuit schools or
colleges. About this period he takes his simple vows in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;I, <i>N.</i>, promise to Almighty God, before His Virgin Mother and
the whole heavenly host, and to thee, Reverend Father General
of the Society of Jesus, holding the place of God, and to thy successors
(or to thee, Reverend Father <i>M.</i> in place of the General of the
Society of Jesus and his successors holding the place of God), Perpetual
Poverty, Chastity and Obedience; and according to it a peculiar
care in the education of boys, according to the manner expressed in
the Apostolic Letter and Constitutions of the said Society.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The lay brothers leave out the clause concerning education.
The scholastic does not begin the study of theology until he is
twenty-eight or thirty, and then passes through a four or six
years&rsquo; course. Only when he is thirty-four or thirty-six can he
be ordained a priest and enter on the grade of a spiritual coadjutor.
A lay brother, before he can become a temporal
coadjutor for the discharge of domestic duties, must pass ten
years before he is admitted to vows. Sometimes after ordination
the priest, in the midst of his work, is again called away
to a third year&rsquo;s novitiate, called the tertianship, as a preparation
for his solemn profession of the three vows. His former
vows were simple and the Society was at liberty to dismiss him
for any canonical reason. The formula of the famous Jesuit
vow is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;I, <i>N.</i>, promise to Almighty God, before His Virgin Mother and
the whole heavenly host, and to all standing by; and to thee, Reverend
Father General of the Society of Jesus, holding the place of God,
and to thy successors (or to thee, Reverend Father <i>M.</i> in place of
the General of the Society of Jesus and his successors holding the
place of God), Perpetual Poverty, Chastity and Obedience; and
according to it a peculiar care in the education of boys according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
the form of life contained in the Apostolic Letters of the Society of
Jesus and in its Constitutions.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Immediately after the vows the Jesuit adds the following
simple vows: (1) that he will never act nor consent that the
provisions in the constitutions concerning poverty should be
changed; (2) that he will not directly nor indirectly procure
election or promotion for himself to any prelacy or dignity
in the Society; (3) that he will not accept or consent to his
election to any dignity or prelacy outside the Society unless
forced thereunto by obedience; (4) that if he knows of others
doing these things he will denounce them to the superiors;
(5) that if elected to a bishopric he will never refuse to hear
such advice as the general may deign to send him and will
follow it if he judges it is better than his own opinion. The
professed is now eligible to certain offices in the Society, and he
may remain as a professed father of the three vows for the rest
of his life. The highest class, who constitute the real core of the
Society, whence all its chief officers are taken, are the professed
of the four vows. This grade can seldom be reached until
the candidate is in his forty-fifth year, which involves a probation
of thirty-one years in the case of those who have entered on
the novitiate at the earliest legal age. The number of these
select members is small in comparison with the whole Society;
the exact proportion varies from time to time, the present tendency
being to increase the number. The vows of this grade
are the same as the last formula, with the addition of the following
important clause:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Moreover I promise the special obedience to the Sovereign
Pontiff concerning missions, as is contained in the same Apostolic
Letter and Constitutions.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>These various members of the Society are distributed in its
novitiate houses, its colleges, its professed houses and its mission
residences. The question has been hotly debated whether,
in addition to these six grades, there be not a seventh answering
in some degree to the tertiaries of the Franciscan and Dominican
orders, but secretly affiliated to the Society and acting as its
emissaries in various lay positions. This class was styled in
France &ldquo;Jesuits of the short robe,&rdquo; and there is some evidence
in support of its actual existence under Louis XV. The Jesuits
themselves deny the existence of any such body, and are able to
adduce the negative disproof that no provision for it is to be
found in their constitutions. On the other hand there are
clauses therein which make the creation of such a class perfectly
feasible if thought expedient. An admitted instance is the case of
Francisco Borgia, who in 1548, while still duke of Gandia, was
received into the Society. What has given colour to the idea is
that certain persons have made vows of obedience to individual
Jesuits; as Thomas Worthington, rector of the Douai seminary,
to Father Robert Parsons; Ann Vaux to Fr. Henry Garnet,
who told her that he was not indeed allowed to receive her vows,
but that she might make them if she wished and then receive his
direction. The archaeologist George Oliver of Exeter was,
according to Foley&rsquo;s <i>Records of the English Province</i>, the last
of the secular priests of England who vowed obedience to the
Society before its suppression.</p>

<p>The general lives permanently at Rome and holds in his hands
the right to appoint, not only to the office of provincial over each
of the head districts into which the Society is mapped, but to
the offices of each house in particular. There is no standard of
electoral right in the Society except in the election of the general
himself. By a minute and frequent system of official and private
reports he is informed of the doings and progress of every
member of the Society and of everything that concerns it
throughout the world. Every Jesuit has not only the right
but the duty in certain cases of communicating, directly and
privately, with his general. While the general thus controls
everything, he himself is not exempt from supervision on the
part of the Society. A consultative council is imposed upon him
by the general congregation, consisting of the assistants of the
various nations, a <i>socius</i>, or adviser, to warn him of mistakes, and
a confessor. These he cannot remove nor select; and he is bound,
in certain circumstances, to listen to their advice, although
he is not obliged to follow it. Once elected the general may
not refuse the office, nor abdicate, nor accept any dignity
or office outside of the Society; on the other hand, for certain
definite reasons, he may be suspended or even deposed by the
authority of the Society, which can thus preserve itself from
destruction. No such instance has occurred, although steps
were once taken in this direction in the case of a general who
had set himself against the current feeling.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is said that the general of the Jesuits is independent of the
pope; and his popular name, &ldquo;the black pope,&rdquo; has gone to confirm
this idea. But it is based on an entirely wrong conception of the
two offices. The suppression of the Society by Clement XIV. in
1773 was an object-lesson in the supremacy of the pope. The
Society became very numerous and, from time to time, received
extraordinary privileges from popes, who were warranted by the
necessities of the times in granting them. A great number of
influential friends, also, gathered round the fathers who, naturally,
sought in every way to retain what had been granted. Popes who
thought it well to bring about certain changes, or to withdraw
privileges that were found to have passed their intentions or to
interfere unduly with the rights of other bodies, often met with
loyal resistances against their proposed measures. Resistance up
to a certain point is lawful and is not disobedience, for every society
has the right of self-preservation. In cases where the popes insisted,
in spite of the representations of the Jesuits, their commands were
obeyed. Many of the popes were distinctly unfavourable to the
Society, while others were as friendly, and often what one pope did
against them the next pope withdrew. Whatever was done in times
when strong divergence of opinion existed, and whatever may have
been the actions of individuals who, even in so highly organized
a body as the Society of Jesus, cannot always be successfully
controlled by their superiors, yet the ultimate result on the part of
the Society has always been obedience to the pope, who authorized,
protected and privileged them, and on whom they ultimately
depend for their very existence.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus constituted, with a skilful union of strictness and
freedom, of complex organization with a minimum of friction
in working, the Society was admirably devised for its purpose
of introducing a new power into the Church and the world.
Its immediate services to the Church were great. The Society
did much, single-handed, to roll back the tide of Protestant
advance when half of Europe, which had not already shaken
off its allegiance to the papacy, was threatening to do so. The
honours of the reaction belong to the Jesuits, and the reactionary
spirit has become their tradition. They had the wisdom to see
and to admit, in their correspondence with their superiors,
that the real cause of the Reformation was the ignorance,
neglect and vicious lives of so many priests. They recognized,
as most earnest men did, that the difficulty was in the higher
places, and that these could best be touched by indirect methods.
At a time when primary or even secondary education had in
most places become a mere effete and pedantic adherence to
obsolete methods, they were bold enough to innovate, both in
system and material. Putting fresh spirit and devotion into the
work, they not merely taught and catechized in a new, fresh
and attractive manner, besides establishing free schools of
good quality, but provided new school books for their pupils
which were an enormous advance on those they found in use;
so that for nearly three centuries the Jesuits were accounted
the best schoolmasters in Europe, as they were, till their forcible
suppression in 1901, confessedly the best in France. The Jesuit
teachers conciliated the goodwill of their pupils by mingled
firmness and gentleness. Although the method of the <i>Ratio
Studiorum</i> has ceased to be acceptable, yet it played in its time as
serious a part in the intellectual development of Europe as did
the method of Frederick the Great in modern warfare. Bacon
succinctly gives his opinion of the Jesuit teaching in these
words: &ldquo;As for the pedagogical part, the shortest rule would
be, Consult the schools of the Jesuits; for nothing better has
been put in practice&rdquo; (<i>De Augmentis</i>, vi. 4). In instruction
they were excellent; but in education, or formation of character,
deficient. Again, when most of the continental clergy had
sunk, more or less, into the moral and intellectual slough which
is pictured for us in the writings of Erasmus and the <i>Epistolae
obscurorum virorum</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hutten, Ulrich von</a></span>), the Jesuits won
back respect for the clerical calling by their personal culture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
and the unimpeachable purity of their lives. These qualities they
have carefully maintained; and probably no large body of men
in the world has been so free from the reproach of discreditable
members or has kept up, on the whole, an equally high average
of intelligence and conduct. As preachers, too, they delivered
the pulpit from the bondage of an effete scholasticism and
reached at once a clearness and simplicity of treatment such as
the English pulpit scarcely begins to exhibit till after the days
of Tillotson; while in literature and theology they count a far
larger number of respectable writers than any other religious
society can boast. It is in the mission field, however, that their
achievements have been most remarkable. Whether toiling
among the teeming millions in Hindustan and China, labouring
amongst the Hurons and Iroquois of North America, governing
and civilizing the natives of Brazil and Paraguay in the
missions and &ldquo;reductions,&rdquo; or ministering, at the hourly risk
of his life to his fellow-Catholics in England under Elizabeth
and the Stuarts, the Jesuit appears alike devoted, indefatigable,
cheerful and worthy of hearty admiration and respect.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, two startling and indisputable facts meet the
student who pursues the history of the Society. The first is the
universal suspicion and hostility it has incurred&mdash;not merely
from the Protestants whose avowed foe it has been, not yet from
the enemies of all clericalism and dogma, but from every Catholic
state and nation in the world. Its chief enemies have been
those of the household of the Roman Catholic faith. The
second fact is the ultimate failure which seems to dog all
its most promising schemes and efforts. These two results
are to be observed alike in the provinces of morals and
politics. The first cause of the opposition indeed redounds
to the Jesuits&rsquo; credit, for it was largely due to their success.
Their pulpits rang with a studied eloquence; their churches,
sumptuous and attractive, were crowded; and in the confessional
their advice was eagerly sought in all kinds of
difficulties, for they were the fashionable professors of the art
of direction. Full of enthusiasm and zeal, devoted wholly to
their Society, they were able to bring in numbers of rich and
influential persons to their ranks; for, with a clear understanding
of the power of wealth, they became, of set purpose, the apostles
of the rich and influential. The Jesuits felt that they were the
new men, the men of the time; so with a perfect confidence in
themselves they went out to set the Church to rights. It was
no wonder that success, so well worked for and so well deserved,
failed to win the approval or sympathy of those who
found themselves supplanted. Old-fashioned men, to whom
the apostles&rsquo; advice to &ldquo;do all to the glory of God&rdquo; seemed
sufficient, mistrusted those who professed to go beyond all
others and adopted as their motto the famous <i>Ad majorem Dei
gloriam</i>, &ldquo;To the greater glory of God.&rdquo; But, besides this, the
<i>esprit de corps</i> which is necessary for every body of men was, it
was held, carried to an excess and made the Jesuits intolerant
of any one or anything if not of &ldquo;ours.&rdquo; The novelties too
which they introduced into the conception of the religious life,
naturally, were displeasing to the older orders, who felt like old
aristocratic families towards a newly rich or purse-proud upstart.
The Society, or rather its members, were too aggressive
and self-assertive to be welcomed; and a certain characteristic,
which soon began to manifest itself in an impatience of episcopal
control, showed that the quality of &ldquo;Jesuitry,&rdquo; usually associated
with the Society, was singularly lacking in their dealings
with opponents. Their political attitude also alienated many.
Many of the Jesuits could not separate religion from politics.
To say this is only to assert that they were not clearer-minded
than most men of their age. But unfortunately they invariably
took the wrong side and allowed themselves to be made the tools
of men who saw farther and more clearly than they did. They
had their share, direct or indirect, in the embroiling of states, in
concocting conspiracies and in kindling wars. They were also
responsible by their theoretical teachings in theological schools,
where cases were considered and treated in the abstract, for not
a few assassinations of the enemies of the cause. Weak minds
heard tyrannicide discussed and defended in the abstract; and
it was no wonder that, when opportunity served, the train that
had been heedlessly laid by speculative professors was fired by
rash hands. What professors like Suarez taught in the calm
atmosphere of the lecture hall, what writers like Mariana upheld
and praised, practical men took as justification for deeds of
blood. There is no evidence that any Jesuit took a direct part
in political assassinations; however, indirectly, they may have
been morally responsible. They were playing with edged tools
and often got wounded through their own carelessness. Other
grievances were raised by their perpetual meddling in politics,
<i>e.g.</i> their large share in fanning the flames of political hatred
against the Huguenots under the last two Valois kings; their
perpetual plotting against England in the reign of Elizabeth;
their share in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War and in the religious miseries
of Bohemia; their decisive influence in causing the revocation
of the edict of Nantes and the expulsion of the Protestants from
France; the ruin of the Stuart cause under James II., and the
establishment of the Protestant succession. In a number of
cases where the evidence against them is defective, it is at least
an unfortunate coincidence that there is always direct proof of
some Jesuit having been in communication with the actual agents
engaged. They were the stormy petrels of politics. Yet the
Jesuits, as a body, should not be made responsible for the doings
of men who, in their political intrigues, were going directly
against the distinct law of the Society, which in strict terms, and
under heavy penalties, forbade them to have anything to do
with such matters. The politicians were comparatively few
in number, though unfortunately they held high rank; and their
disobedience to the rule besmirched the name of the society and
destroyed the good work of the other Jesuits who were faithfully
carrying out their own proper duties.</p>

<p>A far graver cause for uneasiness was given by the Jesuits&rsquo;
activity in the region of doctrine and morals. Here the charges
against them are precise, early, numerous and weighty. Their
founder himself was arrested, more than once, by the Inquisition
and required to give account of his belief and conduct. But
St Ignatius, with all his powerful gifts of intellect, was entirely
practical and ethical in his range, and had no turn whatever for
speculation, nor desire to discuss, much less to question, any of
the received dogmas of the Church. He gives it as a rule of
orthodoxy to be ready to say that black is white if the Church
says so. He was therefore acquitted on every occasion, and
applied each time for a formally attested certificate of his orthodoxy,
knowing well that, in default of such documents, the fact
of his arrest as a suspected heretic would be more distinctly
recollected by opponents than that of his honourable dismissal
from custody. His followers, however, have not been so fortunate.
On doctrinal questions indeed, though their teaching
on grace, especially in the form given to it by Molina (<i>q.v.</i>), ran
contrary to the accepted teaching on the subject by the Augustinians,
Dominicans and other representative schools; yet by
their pertinacity they gained for their views a recognized and
established position. A special congregation of cardinals and
theologians known as <i>de auxiliis</i> was summoned by the pope to
settle the dispute, for the <i>odium theologicum</i> had risen to a
desperate height between the representatives of the old and the
new theology; but after many years they failed to arrive at any
satisfactory conclusion, and the pope, instead of settling the
dispute, was only able to impose mutual silence on all opponents.
Among those who held out stiffly against the Jesuits on the
subject of grace were the Jansenists, who held that they were
following the special teaching of St Augustine, known <i>par
excellence</i> as the doctor of grace. The Jesuits and the Jansenists
soon became deadly enemies; and in the ensuing conflict both
parties accused each other of flinging scruples to the wind. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jansenism</a></span>.)</p>

<p>But the accusations against the Jesuit system of moral theology
and their action as guides of conduct have had a more serious
effect on their reputation. It is undeniable that some of their
moral writers were lax in their teaching; and conscience was
strained to the snapping point. The Society was trying to
make itself all things to all men. Propositions extracted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
Jesuit moral theologians have again and again been condemned
by the pope and declared untenable. Many of these can be
found in Viva&rsquo;s <i>Condemned Propositions</i>. As early as 1554 the
Jesuits were censured by the Sorbonne, chiefly at the instance
of Eustache de Bellay, bishop of Paris, as being dangerous in
matters of faith. Melchor Cano, a Dominican, one of the ablest
divines of the 16th century, never ceased to lift up his testimony
against them, from their first beginnings till his own death in
1560; and, unmollified by the bribe of the bishopric of the
Canaries, which their interest procured for him, he succeeded
in banishing them from the university of Salamanca. Carlo
Borromeo, to whose original advocacy they owed much, especially
in the council of Trent, found himself attacked in his own cathedral
pulpit and interfered with in his jurisdiction. He withdrew
his protection and expelled them from his colleges and churches;
and he was followed in 1604 in this policy by his cousin and
successor Cardinal Federigo Borromeo. St Theresa learnt,
in after years, to mistrust their methods, although she was grateful
to them for much assistance in the first years of her work.
The credit of the Society was seriously damaged by the publication,
at Cracow, in 1612, of the <i>Monita Secreta</i>. This book,
which is undoubtedly a forgery, professes to contain the authoritative
secret instructions drawn up by the general Acquaviva and
given by the superiors of the Society to its various officers and
members. A bold caricature of Jesuit methods, the book has
been ascribed to John Zaorowsky or to Cambilone and Schloss,
all ex-Jesuits, and it is stated to have been discovered in manuscript
by Christian of Brunswick in the Jesuit college at Prague.
It consists of suggestions and methods for extending the influence
of the Jesuits in various ways, for securing a footing in fresh
places, for acquiring wealth, for creeping into households and
leading silly rich widows captive and so forth, all marked with
ambition, craft and unscrupulousness. It had a wide success
and popularity, passing through several editions, and even to
this day it is used by controversialists as unscrupulous as the
original writers. It may, perhaps, represent the actions of some
individuals who allowed their zeal to outrun their discretion,
but surely no society which exists for good and is marked by so
many worthy men could systematically have conducted its
operations in such a manner. Later on a formidable assault
was made on Jesuit moral theology in the famous <i>Provincial
Letters</i> of Blaise Pascal (<i>q.v.</i>), eighteen in number, issued under
the pen-name of Louis de Montalte, from January 1656 to March
1657. Their wit, irony, eloquence and finished style have kept
them alive as one of the great French classics&mdash;a destiny more
fortunate than that of the kindred works by Antoine Arnauld,
<i>Théologie morale des Jésuites</i>, consisting of extracts from writings
of members of the Society, and <i>Morale pratique des Jésuites</i>,
made up of narratives professing to set forth the manner in
which they carried out their own maxims. But, like most
controversial writers, the authors were not scrupulous in their
quotations, and by giving passages divorced from their contexts
often entirely misrepresented their opponents. The immediate
reply on the part of the Jesuits, <i>The Discourses of Cleander and
Eudoxus</i> by Père Daniel, could not compete with Pascal&rsquo;s work
in brilliancy, wit or style; moreover, it was unfortunate enough
to be put upon the Index of prohibited books in 1701. The
reply on behalf of the Society to Pascal&rsquo;s charges of lax
morality, apart from mere general denials, is broadly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) St Ignatius himself, the founder of the Society, had a special
aversion from untruthfulness in all its forms, from quibbling,
equivocation or even studied obscurity of language, and it would be
contrary to the spirit of conformity with his example and institutions
for his followers to think and act otherwise. Hence, any who
practised equivocation were, so far, unfaithful to the Society.
(2) Several of the cases cited by Pascal are mere abstract hypotheses,
many of them now obsolete, argued simply as intellectual exercises,
but having no practical bearing whatever. (3) Even such as do
belong to the sphere of actual life are of the nature of counsel to
spiritual physicians, how to deal with exceptional maladies; and
were never intended to fix the standard of moral obligation for the
general public. (4) The theory that they were intended for this
latter purpose and do represent the normal teaching of the Society
becomes more untenable in exact proportion as this immorality
is insisted on, because it is a matter of notoriety that the Jesuits
themselves have been singularly free from personal, as distinguished
from corporate, evil repute; and no one pretends that the large number
of lay-folk whom they have educated or influenced exhibit
greater moral inferiority than others.</p>
</div>

<p>The third of these replies is the most cogent as regards Pascal,
but the real weakness of his attack lies in that nervous dread of
appeal to first principles and their logical result which has been
the besetting snare of Gallicanism. Pascal, at his best, has mistaken
the part for the whole; he charges to the Society what,
at the most, are the doings of individuals; and from these he
asserts the degeneration of the body from its original standard;
whereas the stronger the life and the more extensive the natural
development, side by side will exist marks of degeneration; and a
society like the Jesuits has no difficulty in asserting its life independently
of such excrescences or, in time, in freeing itself from
them.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A charge persistently made against the Society is that it teaches
that the end justifies the means. And the words of Busembaum,
whose <i>Medulla theologiae</i> has gone through more than fifty editions,
are quoted in proof. True it is that Busembaum uses these words:
<i>Cui licitus est finis etiam licent media</i>. But on turning to his work
(ed. Paris 1729, p. 584, or Lib. vi. Tract vi. cap. ii., <i>De sacramentis</i>,
dubium ii.) it will be found that the author is making no universal
application of an old legal maxim; but is treating of a particular
subject (concerning certain lawful liberties in the marital relation)
beyond which his words cannot be forced. The sense in which other
Jesuit theologians&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> Paul Laymann (1575-1635), in his <i>Theologia
moralis</i> (Munich, 1625), and Ludwig Wagemann (1713-1792), in
his <i>Synopsis theologiae moralis</i> (Innsbruck, 1762)&mdash;quote the axiom
is an equally harmless piece of common sense. For instance, if it
is lawful to go on a journey by railway it is lawful to take a ticket.
No one who put forth that proposition would be thought to mean
that it is lawful to defraud the company by stealing a ticket; for
the <i>proviso</i> is always to be understood, that the means employed
should, in themselves, not be bad but good or at least indifferent.
So when Wagemann says tersely <i>Finis determinat probitatem actus</i>
he is clearly referring to acts which in themselves are indifferent,
<i>i.e.</i> indeterminate. For instance: shooting is an indifferent act,
neither good nor bad in itself. The morality of any specified
shooting depends upon what is shot, and the circumstances attending
that act: shooting a man in self-defence is, as a moral act, on an
entirely different plane to shooting a man in murder. It has never
been proved, and never can be proved, although the attempt has
frequently been made, that the Jesuits ever taught the nefarious
proposition ascribed to them, which would be entirely subversive of
all morality. Again, the doctrine of probabilism is utterly misunderstood.
It is based on an accurate conception of law. Law
to bind must be clear and definite; if it be not so, its obligation ceases
and liberty of action remains. No probable opinion can stand
against a clear and definite law; but when a law is doubtful in
its application, in certain circumstances, so is the obligation of
obedience: and as a doubtful law is, for practical purposes, no law
at all, so it superinduces no obligation. Hence a probable opinion
is one, founded on reason and held on serious grounds, that the law
does not apply to certain specified cases; and that the law-giver
therefore did not intend to bind. It is the principle of equity applied
to law. In moral matters a probable opinion, that is one held on
no trivial grounds but by unprejudiced and solid thinkers, has no
place where the voice of conscience is clear, distinct and formed.</p>
</div>

<p>Two causes have been at work to produce the universal
failure of the great Society in all its plans and efforts. First
stands its lack of really great intellects. It has had its golden
age. No society can keep up to its highest level. Nothing can
be wider of the truth than the popular conception of the ordinary
Jesuit as a being of almost superhuman abilities and universal
knowledge. The Society, numbering as it does so many thousands,
and with abundant means of devoting men to special
branches of study, has, without doubt, produced men of great
intelligence and solid learning. The average member, too, on
account of his long and systematic training, is always equal
and often superior to the average member of any other equally
large body, besides being disciplined by a far more perfect drill.
But it takes great men to carry out great plans; and of really
great men, as the outside world knows and judges, the Society
has been markedly barren from almost the first. Apart from
its founder and his early companion, St Francis Xavier, there is
none who stands in the very first rank. Laynez and Acquaviva
were able administrators and politicians; the Bollandists (<i>q.v.</i>)
were industrious workers and have developed a critical spirit
from which much good can be expected; Francisco Suarez,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
Leonhard Lessius and Cardinal Franzelin were some of the leading
Jesuit theologians; Cornelius a Lapide (1567-1637) represents
their old school of scriptural studies, while their new German
writers are the most advanced of all orthodox higher critics;
the French Louis Bourdaloue (<i>q.v.</i>), the Italian Paolo Segneri
(1624-1694), and the Portuguese Antonio Vieyra (1608-1697)
represent their best pulpit orators; while of the many mathematicians
and astronomers produced by the Society Angelo Secchi,
Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich and G. B. Beccaria are conspicuous,
and in modern times Stephen Joseph Perry (1833-1889), director
of the Stonyhurst College observatory, took a high rank among
men of science. Their boldest and most original thinker, Denis
Petau, so many years neglected, is now, by inspiring Cardinal
Newman&rsquo;s <i>Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine</i>, producing
a permanent influence over the current of human thought.
The Jesuits have produced no Aquinas, no Anselm, no Bacon,
no Richelieu. Men whom they trained, and who broke loose
from their teaching, Pascal, Descartes, Voltaire, have powerfully
affected the philosophical and religious beliefs of great
masses of mankind; but respectable mediocrity is the brand on
the long list of Jesuit names in the catalogues of Alegambe and
De Backer. This is doubtless due in great measure to the destructive
process of scooping out the will of the Jesuit novice, to replace
it with that of his superior (as a watchmaker might fit a new
movement into a case), and thereby tending, in most cases, to
annihilate those subtle qualities of individuality and originality
which are essential to genius. Men of the higher stamp will
either refuse to submit to the process and leave the Society, or
run the danger of coming forth from the mill with their finest
qualities pulverized and useless. In accordance with the spirit
of its founder, who wished to secure uniformity in the judgment
of his followers even in points left open by the Church (&ldquo;Let us
all think the same way, let us all speak in the same manner if
possible&rdquo;), the Society has shown itself to be impatient of those
who think or write in a way different from what is current in its
ranks.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Nor is this all. The <i>Ratio Studiorum</i>, devised by Acquaviva and
still obligatory in the colleges of the Society, lays down rules which
are incompatible with all breadth and progress in the higher forms
of education. True to the anti-speculative and traditional side of
the founder&rsquo;s mind, it prescribes that, even where religious topics are
not in question, the teacher is not to permit any novel opinions or
discussions to be mooted; nor to cite or allow others to cite the
opinions of an author not of known repute; nor to teach or suffer
to be taught anything contrary to the prevalent opinions of acknowledged
doctors current in the schools. Obsolete and false opinions
are not to be mentioned at all, even for refutation, nor are objections
to received teaching to be dwelt on at any length. The result is
that the Jesuit emerges from his schools without any real knowledge
of any other method of thought than that which his professors have
instilled into him. The professor of Biblical Literature is always to
support and defend the Vulgate and can never prefer the marginal
readings from the Hebrew and Greek. The Septuagint, as far as it
is incorrupt, is to be held not less authentic than the Vulgate. In
philosophy Aristotle is always to be followed, and St Thomas
Aquinas generally, care being taken to speak respectfully of him
even when abandoning his opinions, though now it is customary
for the Jesuit teachers to explain him in their own sense. <i>De vera
mente D. Thomas</i> is no unfamiliar expression in their books. It is
not wonderful, under such a method of training, fixed as it has been
in minute detail for more than three hundred years, that highly
cultivated commonplaces should be the inevitable average result;
and that in proportion as Jesuit power has become dominant in
Christendom, especially in ecclesiastical circles, the same doom of
intellectual sterility and consequent loss of influence with the higher
and thoughtful classes, has separated the part from the whole. The
initial mistake in the formation of character is that the Jesuits have
aimed at educating lay boys in the same manner as they consider
advisable for their own novices, for whom obedience and direction
is the one thing necessary; whereas for lay people the right use of
liberty and initiative are to be desired.</p>
</div>

<p>The second cause which has blighted the efforts of the Society
is the lesson, too faithfully learnt and practised, of making its
corporate interests the first object at all times and in all places.
Men were quick to see that Jesuits did not aim at co-operation
with the other members of the Church but directly or indirectly
at mastery. The most brilliant exception to this rule is found in
some of the missions of the Society and notably in that of St
Francis Xavier (<i>q.v.</i>). But he quitted Europe in 1541 before the
new society, especially under Laynez, had hardened into its final
mould; and he never returned. His work, so far as can be
gathered from contemporary accounts, was not done on true
Jesuit lines as they afterwards developed, though the Society
has reaped all the credit; and it is even possible that, had he
succeeded the founder as general, the institute might not have
received that political and self-seeking turn which Laynez, as
second general, gave at the critical moment.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It would almost seem that careful selection was made of the men
of the greatest piety and enthusiasm, whose unworldliness made
them less apt for diplomatic intrigues, to break new ground in the
various missions where their success would throw lustre on the
Society and their scruples need never come into play. But such
men are not to be found easily; and, as they died off, the tendency
was to fill their places with more ordinary characters, whose aim was
to increase the power and resources of the body. Hence the condescension
to heathen rites in Hindustan and China, and the attempted
subjugation of the English Catholic clergy. The first successes of
the Indian mission were entirely among the lower classes; but when
in Madura, in 1606, Robert de Nobili, a nephew of Bellarmine, to
win the Brahmins, adopted their dress and mode of life&mdash;a step
sanctioned by Gregory XV. in 1623 and by Clement XI. in 1707&mdash;the
fathers who followed his example pushed the new caste-feeling so far
as absolutely to refuse the ministrations and sacraments to the
pariahs, lest the Brahmin converts should take offence&mdash;an attempt
which was reported to Rome and was vainly censured by the breves
of Innocent X. in 1645, Clement IX. in 1669, Clement XII. in 1734
and 1739, and Benedict XIV. in 1745. The Chinese rites, assailed
with equal unsuccess by one pope after another, were not finally
put down until 1744 by a bull of Benedict XIV. For Japan, where
their side of the story is that best known, we have a remarkable
letter, printed by Lucas Wadding in the <i>Annales minorum</i>, addressed
to Paul V. by Soleto, a Franciscan missionary, who was martyred
in 1624, in which he complains to the pope that the Jesuits systematically
postponed the spiritual welfare of the native Christians to
their own convenience and advantage; while as regards the test of
martyrdom, no such result had followed on their teaching, but only
on that of the other orders who had undertaken missionary work
in Japan. Yet soon many Jesuit martyrs in Japan were to shed a
new glory on the Society (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Japan</a></span>: <i>Foreign Intercourse</i>). Again,
even in Paraguay, the most promising of all Jesuit undertakings,
the evidence shows that the fathers, though civilizing the Guarani
population just sufficiently to make them useful and docile servants,
happier no doubt than they were before or after, stopped there.
While the mission was begun on the rational principle of governing
races still in their childhood by methods adapted to that stage in
their mental development, yet for one hundred and fifty years the
&ldquo;reductions&rdquo; were conducted in the same manner, and when the
hour of trial came the Jesuit civilization fell like a house of cards.</p>
</div>

<p>These examples are sufficient to explain the final collapse of so
many promising efforts. The individual Jesuit might be, and
often was, a hero, saint and martyr, but the system which he
was obliged to administer was foredoomed to failure; and the
suppression which came in 1773 was the natural result of forces
and elements they had set in antagonism without the power of
controlling.</p>

<p>The influence of the Society since its restoration in 1814 has
not been marked with greater success than in its previous history.
It was natural after the restoration that an attempt should be
made to pick up again the threads that were dropped; but soon
they came to realize the truth of the saying of St Ignatius:
&ldquo;The Society shall adapt itself to the times and not the times
to the Society.&rdquo; The political conditions of Europe have completely
changed, and constitutionalism is unfavourable to that
personal influence which, in former times, the Jesuits were able
to bring to bear upon the heads of states. In Europe they
confine themselves mainly to educational and ecclesiastical
politics, although both Germany and France have followed the
example of Portugal and refuse, on political grounds, to allow
them to be in these countries. It would appear as though
some of the Jesuits had not, even yet, learnt the lesson that
meddling with politics has always been their ruin. The main
cause of any difficulty that may exist to-day with the Society is
that the Jesuits are true to the teaching of that remarkable
panegyric, the <i>Imago primi saeculi Societatis</i> (probably written
by John Tollenarius in 1640), by identifying the Church with their
own body, and being intolerant of all who will not share this view.
Their power is still large in certain sections of the ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
world, but in secular affairs it is small. Moreover within the
church itself there is a strong and growing feeling that the
interests of Catholicism may necessitate a second and final
suppression of the Society. Cardinal Manning, a keen observer
of times and influences, was wont to say:&mdash;&ldquo;The work of 1773
was the work of God: and there is another 1773 coming.&rdquo;
But, if this come, it will be due not to the pressure of secular
governments, as in the 18th century, but to the action of the
Church itself. The very nations which have cast out the Society
have shown no disposition to accept its own estimate and identify
it with the Church; while the Church itself is not conscious of
depending upon the Society. To the Church the Jesuits have
been what the Janissaries were to the Ottoman Empire, at first
its defenders and its champions, but in the end its taskmasters.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The separate article on Loyola tells of his early
years, his conversion, and his first gathering of companions. It
was not until November 1537, when all hope of going to the Holy
Land was given up, that any outward steps were taken to form
these companions into an organized body. It was on the eve
of their going to Rome, for the second time, that the fathers
met Ignatius at Vicenza and it was determined to adopt a common
rule and, at the suggestion of Ignatius, the name of the
Company of Jesus. Whatever may have been his private hopes
and intentions, it was not until he, Laynez and Faber (Pierre
Lefevre), in the name of their companions, were sent to lay their
services at the feet of the pope that the history of the Society
really begins.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>On their arrival at Rome the three Jesuits were favourably received
by Paul III., who at once appointed Faber to the chair of
scripture and Laynez to that of scholastic theology in the university
of the Sapienza. But they encountered much opposition and were
even charged with heresy; when this accusation had been disposed
of, there were still difficulties in the way of starting any new order.
Despite the approval of Cardinal Contarini and the goodwill of the
pope (who is said to have exclaimed on perusing the scheme of
Ignatius, &ldquo;The finger of God is here&rdquo;), there was a strong and
general feeling that the regular system had broken down and could
not be wisely developed farther. Cardinal Guidiccioni, one of the
commission of three appointed to examine the draft constitution,
was known to advocate the abolition of all existing orders, save four
which were to be remodelled and put under strict control. That
very year, 1538, a commission of cardinals, including Reginald
Pole, Contarini, Sadolet, Caraffa (afterwards Paul IV.), Fregoso
and others, had reported that the conventual orders, which they had
to deal with, had drifted into such a state that they should all be
abolished. Not only so, but, when greater strictness of rule and of
enclosure seemed the most needful reforms in communities that had
become too secular in tone, the proposal of Ignatius, to make it a
first principle that the members of his institute should mix freely in
the world and be as little marked off as possible externally from secular
clerical life and usages, ran counter to all tradition and prejudice,
save that Caraffa&rsquo;s then recent order of Theatines, which had some
analogy with the proposed Society, had taken some steps in the same
direction.</p>

<p>Ignatius and his companions, however, had but little doubt of
ultimate success, and so bound themselves, on the 15th of April 1539,
to obey any superior chosen from amongst their body, and added
on the 4th of May certain other rules, the most important of which
was a vow of special allegiance to the pope for mission purposes to
be taken by all the members of the society. But Guidiccioni, on a
careful study of the papers, changed his mind; it is supposed that the
cause of this change was in large measure the strong interest in the
new scheme exhibited by John III., king of Portugal, who instructed
his ambassador to press it on the pope and to ask Ignatius to send
some priests of his Society for mission work in Portugal and its
Indian possessions. Francis Xavier and Simon Rodriguez were
sent to the king in March 1540. Obstacles being cleared away,
Paul III., on the 27th of September 1540, issued his bull <i>Regimini
militantis ecclesiae</i>, by which he confirmed the new Society (the term
&ldquo;order&rdquo; does not belong to it), but limited the members to sixty,
a restriction which was removed by the same pope in the bull
<i>Injunctum nobis</i> of the 14th of March 1543. In the former bull,
the pope gives the text of the formula submitted by Ignatius as the
scheme of the proposed society, and in it we get the founder&rsquo;s
own ideas: &ldquo;... This Society, instituted to this special end,
namely, to offer spiritual consolation for the advancement of souls
in life and Christian doctrine, for the propagation of the faith by
public preaching and the ministry of the word of God, spiritual
exercises and works of charity and, especially, by the instruction
of children and ignorant people in Christianity, and by the spiritual
consolation of the faithful in Christ in hearing confessions....&rdquo;
In this original scheme it is clearly marked out &ldquo;that this entire
Society and all its members fight for God under the faithful obedience
of the most sacred lord, the pope, and the other Roman pontiffs his
successors&rdquo;; and Ignatius makes particular mention that each member
should &ldquo;be bound by a special vow,&rdquo; beyond that formal
obligation under which all Christians are of obeying the pope, &ldquo;so
that whatsoever the present and other Roman pontiffs for the time
being shall ordain, pertaining to the advancement of souls and the
propagation of the faith, to whatever provinces he shall resolve to
send us, we are straightway bound to obey, as far as in us lies, without
any tergiversation or excuse, whether he send us among the Turks
or to any other unbelievers in being, even to those parts called India,
or to any heretics or schismatics or likewise to any believers.&rdquo;
Obedience to the general is enjoined &ldquo;in all things pertaining to the
institute of the Society ... and in him they shall acknowledge
Christ as though present, and as far as is becoming shall venerate
him&rdquo;; poverty is enjoined, and this rule affects not only the individual
but the common sustentation or care of the Society, except
that in the case of colleges revenues are allowed &ldquo;to be applied to
the wants and necessities of the students&rdquo;; and the private recitation
of the Office is distinctly mentioned. On the other hand, the
perpetuity of the general&rsquo;s office during his life was no part of the
original scheme.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 7th of April 1541, Ignatius was unanimously chosen
general. His refusal of this post was overruled, so he entered
on his office on the 13th of April; and two days after, the newly
constituted Society took its formal corporate vows in the basilica
of San Paolo <i>fuori le mura</i>. Scarcely was the Society launched
when its members dispersed in various directions to their new
tasks. Alfonso Salmeron and Pasquier-Brouet, as papal delegates,
were sent on a secret mission to Ireland to encourage the
native clergy and people to resist the religious changes introduced
by Henry VIII.; Nicholas Bobadilla went to Naples; Faber, first
to the diet of Worms and then to Spain; Laynez and Claude le Jay
to Germany, while Ignatius busied himself at Rome in good works
and in drawing up the constitutions and completing the <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i>. Success crowned these first efforts; and the Society
began to win golden opinions. The first college was founded at
Coimbra in 1542 by John III. of Portugal and put under the
rectorship of Rodriguez. It was designed as a training school to
feed the Indian mission of which Francis Xavier had already
taken the oversight, while a seminary at Goa was the second
institution founded outside Rome in connexion with the Society.
Both from the original scheme and from the foundation at
Coimbra it is clear that the original idea of the colleges was to
provide for the education of future Jesuits. In Spain, national
pride in the founder aided the Society&rsquo;s cause almost as much as
royal patronage did in Portugal; and the third house was opened
in Gandia under the protection of its duke, Francisco Borgia, a
grandson of Alexander VI. In Germany, the Jesuits were
eagerly welcomed as the only persons able to meet the Lutherans
on equal terms. Only in France, among the countries which
still were united with the Roman Church, was their advance
checked, owing to political distrust of their Spanish origin, together
with the hostility of the Sorbonne and the bishop of Paris.
However, after many difficulties, they succeeded in getting a
footing through the help of Guillaume du Prat, bishop of
Clermont (d. 1560), who founded a college for them in 1545 in the
town of Billom, besides making over to them his house at Paris,
the hôtel de Clermont, which became the nucleus of the afterwards
famous college of Louis-le-Grand, while a formal legalization
was granted to them by the states-general at Poissy in 1561.
In Rome, Paul III.&rsquo;s favour did not lessen. He bestowed on
them the church of St Andrea and conferred at the same time
the valuable privilege of making and altering their own statutes;
besides the other points, in 1546, which Ignatius had still more at
heart, as touching the very essence of his institute, namely,
exemption from ecclesiastical offices and dignities and from the
task of acting as directors and confessors to convents of women.
The former of these measures effectually stopped any drain of
the best members away from the society and limited their hopes
within its bounds, by putting them more freely at the general&rsquo;s
disposal, especially as it was provided that the final vows could
not be annulled, nor could a professed member be dismissed, save
by the joint action of the general and the pope. The regulation
as to convents seems partly due to a desire to avoid the worry
and expenditure of time involved in the discharge of such offices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
and partly to a conviction that penitents living in enclosure, as
all religious persons then were, would be of no effective use to the
Society; whereas the founder, against the wishes of several of his
companions, laid much stress on the duty of accepting the post
of confessor to kings, queens and women of high rank when
opportunity presented itself. And the year 1546 is notable in
the annals of the Society as that in which it embarked on its
great educational career, especially by the annexation of free
day-schools to all its colleges.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The council of Trent, in its first period, seemed to increase the
reputation of the Society; for the pope chose Laynez, Faber and
Salmeron to act as his theologians in that assembly, and in this
capacity they had no little influence in framing its decrees. When
the council reassembled under Pius IV., Laynez and Salmeron again
attended in the same capacity. It is sometimes said that the council
formally approved of the Society. This is impossible; for as the
Society had received the papal approval, that of the council would
have been impertinent as well as unnecessary. St Charles Borromeo
wrote to the presiding cardinals, on the 11th of May 1562, saying that,
as France was disaffected to the Jesuits whom the pope wished to
see established in every country, Pius IV. desired, when the council
was occupying itself about regulars, that it should make some
honourable mention of the Society in order to recommend it. This
was done in the twenty-fifth session (cap. XVI., d.r.) when the
decree was passed that at the end of the time of probation novices
should either be professed or dismissed; and the words of the council
are: &ldquo;By these things, however, the Synod does not intend to make
any innovation or prohibition, so as to hinder the religious order of
Clerks of the Society of Jesus from being able to serve God and His
Church, in accordance with their pious institute approved of by the
Holy Apostolic See.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In 1548 the Society received a valuable recruit in the person of
Francisco Borgia, duke of Gandia, afterwards thrice general,
while two important events marked 1550&mdash;the foundation of the
Collegio Romano and a fresh confirmation of the Society by
Julius III. The German college, for the children of poor nobles,
was founded in 1552; and in the same year Ignatius firmly settled
the discipline of the Society by putting down, with promptness
and severity, some attempts at independent action on the part
of Rodriguez at Coimbra&mdash;this being the occasion of the famous
letter on obedience; while 1553 saw the despatch of a mission to
Abyssinia with one of the fathers as patriarch, and the first rift
within the lute when the pope thought that the Spanish Jesuits
were taking part with the emperor against the Holy See.
Paul IV. (whose election alarmed the Jesuits, for they had not
found him very friendly as cardinal) was for a time managed
with supreme tact by Ignatius, whom he respected personally.
In 1556, the founder died and left the Society consisting of forty-five
professed fathers and two thousand ordinary members,
distributed over twelve provinces, with more than a hundred
colleges and houses.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>After the death of the first general there was an interregnum of
two years, with Laynez as vicar. During this long period he occupied
himself with completing the constitutions by incorporating
certain declarations, said to be Ignatian, which explained and
sometimes completely altered the meaning of the original text.
Laynez was an astute politician and saw the vast capabilities of
the Society over a far wider field than the founder contemplated;
and he prepared to give it the direction that it has since followed.
In some senses, this learned and consummately clever man may be
looked upon as the real founder of the Society as history knows it.
Having carefully prepared the way, he summoned the general
congregation from which he emerged as second general in 1556.
As soon as Ignatius had died Paul IV. announced his intention of instituting
reforms in the Society, especially in two points: the public
recitation of the office in choir and the limitation of the general&rsquo;s
office to a term of three years. Despite all the protests and negotiations
of Laynez, the pope remained obstinate; and there was
nothing but to submit. On the 8th of September 1558, two points
were added to the constitutions: that the generalship should be
triennial and not perpetual, although after the three years the general
might be confirmed; and that the canonical hours should be observed
in choir after the manner of the other orders, but with that moderation
which should seem expedient to the general. Taking advantage
of this last clause, Laynez applied the new law to two houses only,
namely, Rome and Lisbon, the other houses contenting themselves
with singing vespers on feast days; and as soon as Paul IV. died,
Laynez, acting on advice, quietly ignored for the future the orders
of the late pope. He also succeeded in increasing further the already
enormous powers of the general. Laynez took a leading part in the
colloquy of Poissy in 1561 between the Catholics and Huguenots;
and obtained a legal footing from the states-general for colleges
of the Society in France. He died in 1564, leaving the Society
increased to eighteen provinces with a hundred and thirty colleges,
and was succeeded by Francisco Borgia. During the third generalate,
Pius V. confirmed all the former privileges, and in the amplest
form extended to the Society, as being a mendicant institute, all
favours that had been or might afterwards be granted to such mendicant
bodies. It was a trifling set-off that in 1567 the pope again
enjoined the fathers to keep choir and to admit only the professed
to priests&rsquo; orders, especially as Gregory XIII. rescinded both these
injunctions in 1573; and indeed, as regards the hours, all that
Pius V. was able to obtain was the nominal concession that the breviary
should be recited in choir in the professed houses only, and
that not of necessity by more than two persons at a time. Everard
Mercurian, a Fleming, and a subject of Spain, succeeded Borgia in
1573, being forced on the Society by the pope, in preference to
Polanco, Ignatius&rsquo;s secretary and the vicar-general, who was rejected
partly as a Spaniard and still more because he was a &ldquo;New
Christian&rdquo; of Jewish origin and therefore objected to in Spain
itself. During his term of office there took place the troubles in
Rome concerning the English college and the subsequent Jesuit
rule over that institution; and in 1580 the first Jesuit mission,
headed by the redoubtable Robert Parsons and the saintly Edmund
Campion, set out for England. This mission, on one side, carried
on an active propaganda against Elizabeth in favour of Spain; and
on the other, among the true missionaries, was marked with devoted
zeal and heroism even to the ghastly death of traitors. Claude
Acquaviva, the fifth general, held office from 1581 to 1615, a time
almost coinciding with the high tide of the successful reaction, chiefly
due to the Jesuits. He was an able, strong-willed man, and crushed
what was tantamount to a rebellion in Spain. It was during this
struggle that Mariana, the historian and the author of the famous
<i>De rege</i> in which he defends tyrannicide, wrote his treatise <i>On the
Defects in the Government of the Society</i>. He confessed freely that the
Society had faults and that there was a great deal of unrest among
the members; and he mentioned among the various points calling
for reform the education of the novices and students; the state of
the lay brother and the possessions of the Society; the spying system,
which he declared to be carried so far that, if the general&rsquo;s archives
at Rome should be searched, not one Jesuit&rsquo;s character would be
found to escape; the monopoly of the higher offices by a small clique;
and the absence of all encouragement and recompense for the best
men of the Society.</p>
</div>

<p>It was chiefly during the generalship of Acquaviva that the
Society began to gain an evil reputation which eclipsed its good
report. In France the Jesuits joined, if they did not originate,
the league against Henry of Navarre. Absolution was refused
by them to those who would not join in the Guise rebellion, and
Acquaviva is said to have tried to stop them, but in vain. The
assassination of Henry III. in the interests of the league and the
wounding of Henry IV. in 1594 by Chastel, a pupil of theirs,
revealed the danger that the whole Society was running by the
intrigues of a few men. The Jesuits were banished from France
in 1594, but were allowed to return by Henry IV. under conditions;
as Sully has recorded, the king declared his only motive
to be the expediency of not driving them into a corner with
possible disastrous results to his life, and because his only hope of
tranquillity lay in appeasing them and their powerful friends.
In England the political schemings of Parsons were no small
factors in the odium which fell on the Society at large; and his
determination to capture the English Catholics as an apanage
of the Society, to the exclusion of all else, was an object lesson to
the rest of Europe of a restless ambition and lust of domination
which were to find many imitators. The political turn which
was being given by some to the Society, to the detriment of its
real spiritual work, evoked the fears of the wiser heads of the
body; and in the fifth general congregation held in 1593-1594 it
was decreed: &ldquo;Whereas in these times of difficulty and danger
it has happened through the fault of certain individuals, through
ambition and intemperate zeal, that our institute has been ill
spoken of in divers places and before divers sovereigns ...
it is severely and strictly forbidden to all members of the Society
to interfere in any manner whatever in public affairs even though
they be thereto invited; or to deviate from the institute through
entreaty, persuasion or any other motive whatever.&rdquo; It would
have been well had Acquaviva enforced this decree; but Parsons
was allowed to keep on with his work, and other Jesuits in
France for many years after directed, to the loss of religion,
affairs of state. In 1605 took place in England the Gunpowder
Plot, in which Henry Garnet, the superior of the Society in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
England, was implicated. That the Jesuits were the instigators
of the plot there is no evidence, but they were in close touch with
the conspirators, of whose designs Garnet had a general knowledge.
There is now no reasonable doubt that he and other
Jesuits were legally accessories, and that the condemnation of
Garnet as a traitor was substantially just (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Garnet, Henry</a></span>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It was during Acquaviva&rsquo;s generalship that Philip II. of Spain
complained bitterly of the Society to Sixtus V., and encouraged him
in those plans of reform (even to changing the name) which were
only cut short by the pope&rsquo;s death in 1590, and also that the long
protracted discussions on grace, wherein the Dominicans contended
against the Jesuits, were carried on at Rome with little practical
result, by the Congregation <i>de auxiliis</i>, which sat from 1598 till 1607.
The <i>Ratio Studiorum</i> took its shape during this time. The Jesuit influence
at Rome was supported by the Spanish ambassador; but when
Henry IV. &ldquo;went to Mass,&rdquo; the balance inclined to the side of
France, and the Spanish monopoly became a thing of the past.
Acquaviva saw the expulsion of the Jesuits from Venice in 1606
for siding with Paul V. when he placed the republic under interdict,
but did not live to see their recall, which took place at the intercession
of Louis XIV. in 1657. He also had to banish Parsons from
Rome, by order of Clement VIII., who was wearied with the perpetual
complaints made against that intriguer. Gregory XIV., by
the bull <i>Ecclesiae Christi</i> (July 28, 1591), again confirmed the
Society, and granted that Jesuits might, for true cause, be expelled
from the body without any form of trial or even documentary procedure,
besides denouncing excommunications against every one,
save the pope or his legates, who directly or indirectly infringed the
constitutions of the Society or attempted to bring about any change
therein.</p>

<p>Under Vitelleschi, the next general, the Society celebrated its
first centenary on the 25th of September 1639, the hundredth anniversary
of the verbal approbation given to the scheme by Paul III.
During this hundred years the Society had grown to thirty-six
provinces, with eight hundred houses containing some fifteen
thousand members. In 1640 broke out the great Jansenist controversy,
in which the Society took the leading part on one side
and finally secured the victory. In this same year, considering
themselves ill-used by Olivarez, prime minister of Philip IV. of
Spain, the Jesuits powerfully aided the revolution which placed the
duke of Braganza on the throne of Portugal; and their services were
rewarded for nearly one hundred years with the practical control
of ecclesiastical and almost of civil affairs in that kingdom.</p>

<p>The Society also gained ground steadily in France; for, though
held in check by Richelieu and little more favoured by Mazarin,
yet from the moment that Louis XIV. took the reins, their star
was in the ascendant, and Jesuit confessors, the most celebrated of
whom were François de La Chaise (<i>q.v.</i>) and Michel Le Tellier (1643-1719),
guided the policy of the king, not hesitating to take his side
in his quarrel with the Holy See, which nearly resulted in a schism,
nor to sign the Gallican articles. Their hostility to the Huguenots
forced on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and their
war against their Jansenist opponents did not cease till the very
walls of Port Royal were demolished in 1710, even to the very abbey
church itself, and the bodies of the dead taken with every mark of
insult from their graves and literally flung to the dogs to devour.
But while thus gaining power in one direction, the Society was losing
it in another. The Japanese mission had vanished in blood in 1651;
and though many Jesuits died with their converts bravely as martyrs
for the faith, yet it is impossible to acquit them of a large share in the
causes of that overthrow. It was also about this same period that
the grave scandal of the Chinese and Malabar rites began to attract
attention in Europe, and to make thinking men ask seriously
whether the Jesuit missionaries in those parts taught anything which
could fairly be called Christianity at all. When it was remembered,
too, that they had decided, at a council held at Lima, that it was
inexpedient to impose any act of Christian devotion except baptism,
on the South American converts, without the greatest precautions,
on the ground of intellectual difficulties, it is not wonderful that this
doubt was not satisfactorily cleared up, notably in face of the
charges brought against the Society by Bernardin de Cardonas,
bishop of Paraguay, and the saintly Juan de Palafox (<i>q.v.</i>), bishop
of Angelopolis in Mexico.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;the terrible power in the universal church, the great riches
and the extraordinary prestige&rdquo; of the Society, which Palafox
complained had raised it &ldquo;above all dignities, laws, councils and
apostolic constitutions,&rdquo; carried with them the seeds of rapid and
inevitable decay. A succession of devout but incapable generals,
after the death of Acquaviva, saw the gradual secularization of tone
by the flocking in of recruits of rank and wealth desirous to share in
the glories and influence of the Society, but not well adapted to increase
them. The general&rsquo;s supremacy received a shock when the
eleventh general congregation appointed Oliva as vicar, with the
right of succession and powers that practically superseded those of
the general Goswin Nickel, whose infirmities, it is said, did not permit
him to govern with the necessary application and vigour; and an
attempt was made to depose Tirso Gonzalez, the thirteenth general,
whose views on probabilism diverged from those favoured by the rest
of the Jesuits. Though the political weight of the Society continued
to increase in the cabinets of Europe, it was being steadily weakened
internally. The Jesuits abandoned the system of free education
which had won them so much influence and honour; by attaching
themselves exclusively to the interests of courts, they lost favour
with the middle and lower classes; and above all, their monopoly
of power and patronage in France, with the fatal use they had made of
it, drew down the bitterest hostility upon them. It was to their credit,
indeed, that the encyclopaedists attacked them as the foremost
representatives of Christianity, but they are accountable in no small
degree in France, as in England, for alienating the minds of men
from the religion for which they professed to work.</p>
</div>

<p>But the most fatal part of the policy of the Society was its
activity, wealth and importance as a great trading firm with
branch houses scattered over the richest countries of the world.
Its founder, with a wise instinct, had forbidden the accumulation
of wealth; its own constitutions, as revised in the 84th decree of
the sixth general congregation, had forbidden all pursuits of a
commercial nature, as also had various popes; but nevertheless
the trade went on unceasingly, necessarily with the full knowledge
of the general, unless it be pleaded that the system of
obligatory espionage had completely broken down. The first
muttering of the storm which was soon to break was heard in a
breve issued in 1741 by Benedict XIV., wherein he denounced
the Jesuit offenders as &ldquo;disobedient, contumacious, captious and
reprobate persons,&rdquo; and enacted many stringent regulations for
their better government. The first serious attack came from a
country where they had been long dominant. In 1753 Spain
and Portugal exchanged certain American provinces with each
other, which involved a transfer of sovereign rights over Paraguay;
but it was also provided that the populations should
severally migrate also, that the subjects of each crown might
remain the same as before. The inhabitants of the &ldquo;reductions,&rdquo;
whom the Jesuits had trained in the use of European arms and
discipline, naturally rose in defence of their homes, and attacked
the troops and authorities. Their previous docility and their
entire submission to the Jesuits left no possible doubt as to the
source of the rebellion, and gave the enemies of the Jesuits a
handle against them that was not forgotten. In 1757 Carvalho,
marquis of Pombal, prime minister of Joseph I. of Portugal, and
an old pupil of the Jesuits at Coimbra, dismissed the three Jesuit
chaplains of the king and named three secular priests in their
stead. He next complained to Benedict XIV. that the trading
operations of the Society hampered the commercial prosperity
of the nation, and asked for remedial measures. The pope, who
knew the situation, committed a visitation of the Society to
Cardinal Saldanha, an intimate friend of Pombal, who issued a
severe decree against the Jesuits and ordered the confiscation
of all their merchandise. But at this juncture Benedict XIV.,
the most learned and able pope of the period, was succeeded by
a pope strongly in favour of the Jesuits, Clement XIII. Pombal,
finding no help from Rome, adopted other means. The king was
fired at and wounded on returning from a visit to his mistress
on the 3rd of September 1758. The duke of Aveiro and other
high personages were tried and executed for conspiracy; while
some of the Jesuits, who had undoubtedly been in communication
with them, were charged, on doubtful evidence, with
complicity in the attempted assassination. Pombal charged the
whole Society with the possible guilt of a few, and, unwilling to
wait the dubious issue of an application to the pope for licence
to try them in the civil courts, whence they were exempt, issued
on the 1st of September 1759 a decree ordering the immediate
deportation of every Jesuit from Portugal and all its dependencies
and their suppression by the bishops in the schools and universities.
Those in Portugal were at once shipped, in great misery, to
the papal states, and were soon followed by those in the colonies.
In France, Madame de Pompadour was their enemy because they
had refused her absolution while she remained the king&rsquo;s mistress;
but the immediate cause of their ruin was the bankruptcy of
Father Lavalette, the Jesuit superior in Martinique, a daring
speculator, who failed, after trading for some years, for 2,400,000
francs and brought ruin upon some French commercial houses
of note. Lorenzo Ricci, then general of the Society, repudiated
the debt, alleging lack of authority on Lavalette&rsquo;s part to pledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
the credit of the Society, and he was sued by the creditors. Losing
his cause, he appealed to the parlement of Paris, and it, to
decide the issue raised by Ricci, required the constitutions of the
Jesuits to be produced in evidence, and affirmed the judgment of
the courts below. But the publicity given to a document scarcely
known till then raised the utmost indignation against the Society.
A royal commission, appointed by the duc de Choiseul to examine
the constitutions, convoked a private assembly of fifty-one archbishops
and bishops under the presidency of Cardinal de Luynes,
all of whom except six voted that the unlimited authority of the
general was incompatible with the laws of France, and that the
appointment of a resident vicar, subject to those laws, was the
only solution of the question fair on all sides. Ricci replied with
the historical answer, <i>Sint ut sunt, aut non sint</i>; and after some
further delay, during which much interest was exerted in their
favour, the Jesuits were suppressed by an edict in November
1764, but suffered to remain on the footing of secular priests,
a grace withdrawn in 1767, when they were expelled from the
kingdom. In the very same year, Charles III. of Spain, a
monarch known for personal devoutness, convinced, on evidence
not now forthcoming, that the Jesuits were plotting against his
authority, prepared, through his minister D&rsquo;Aranda, a decree
suppressing the Society in every part of his dominions. Sealed
despatches were sent to every Spanish colony, to be opened on
the same day, the 2nd of April 1767, when the measure was to
take effect in Spain itself, and the expulsion was relentlessly
carried out, nearly six thousand priests being deported from
Spain alone, and sent to the Italian coast, whence, however, they
were repelled by the orders of the pope and Ricci himself, finding
a refuge at Corte in Corsica, after some months&rsquo; suffering in overcrowded
vessels at sea. The general&rsquo;s object may probably have
been to accentuate the harshness with which the fathers had been
treated, and so to increase public sympathy, but the actual result
of his policy was blame for the cruelty with which he enhanced
their misfortunes, for the poverty of Corsica made even a bare
subsistence scarcely procurable for them there. The Bourbon
courts of Naples and Parma followed the example of France and
Spain; Clement XIII. retorted with a bull launched at the
weakest adversary, and declaring the rank and title of the duke
of Parma forfeit. The Bourbon sovereigns threatened to make
war on the pope in return (France, indeed, seizing on the county
of Avignon), and a joint note demanding a retractation, and the
abolition of the Jesuits, was presented by the French ambassador
at Rome on the 10th of December 1768 in the name of France,
Spain and the two Sicilies. The pope, a man of eighty-two, died
of apoplexy, brought on by the shock, early in 1769. Cardinal
Lorenzo Ganganelli, a conventual Franciscan, was chosen to
succeed him, and took the name of Clement XIV. He endeavoured
to avert the decision forced upon him, but, as Portugal
joined the Bourbon league, and Maria Theresa with her son the
emperor Joseph II. ceased to protect the Jesuits, there remained
only the petty kingdom of Sardinia in their favour, though the fall
of Choiseul in France raised the hopes of the Society for a time.
The pope began with some preliminary measures, permitting
first the renewal of lawsuits against the Society, which had been
suspended by papal authority, and which, indeed, had in no case
been ever successful at Rome. He then closed the Collegio
Romano, on the plea of its insolvency, seized the houses at
Frascati and Tivoli, and broke up the establishments in Bologna
and the Legations. Finally on the 21st of July 1773 the famous
breve <i>Dominus ac Redemptor</i> appeared, suppressing the Society of
Jesus. This remarkable document opens by citing a long series
of precedents for the suppression of religious orders by the Holy
See, amongst which occurs the ill-omened instance of the
Templars. It then briefly sketches the objects and history of
the Jesuits themselves. It speaks of their defiance of their own
constitution, expressly revived by Paul V., forbidding them to
meddle in politics; of the great ruin to souls caused by their
quarrels with local ordinaries and the other religious orders, their
condescension to heathen usages in the East, and the disturbances,
resulting in persecutions of the Church, which they had stirred
up even in Catholic countries, so that several popes had been
obliged to punish them. Seeing then that the Catholic sovereigns
had been forced to expel them, that many bishops and other
eminent persons demanded their extinction, and that the Society
had ceased to fulfil the intention of its institute, the pope declares
it necessary for the peace of the Church that it should be suppressed,
extinguished, abolished and abrogated for ever, with
all its houses, colleges, schools and hospitals; transfers all the
authority of its general or officers to the local ordinaries; forbids
the reception of any more novices, directing that such as were
actually in probation should be dismissed, and declaring that
profession in the Society should not serve as a title to holy orders.
Priests of the Society are given the option of either joining other
orders or remaining as secular clergy, under obedience to the
ordinaries, who are empowered to grant or withhold from them
licences to hear confessions. Such of the fathers as are engaged
in the work of education are permitted to continue, on condition
of abstaining from lax and questionable doctrines apt to cause
strife and trouble. The question of missions is reserved, and the
relaxations granted to the Society in such matters as fasting,
reciting the hours and reading heretical books, are withdrawn;
while the breve ends with clauses carefully drawn to bar any
legal exceptions that might be taken against its full validity and
obligation. It has been necessary to cite these heads of the breve
because the apologists of the Society allege that no motive
influenced the pope save the desire of peace at any price, and that
he did not believe in the culpability of the fathers. The categorical
charges made in the document rebut this plea. The pope
followed up this breve by appointing a congregation of cardinals
to take possession of the temporalities of the Society, and armed
it with summary powers against all who should attempt to
retain or conceal any of the property. He also threw Lorenzo
Ricci, the general, into prison, first in the English college and
then in the castle of St Angelo, where he died in 1775, under the
pontificate of Pius VI., who, though not unfavourable to the
Society, and owing his own advancement to it, dared not release
him, probably because his continued imprisonment was made a
condition by the powers who enjoyed a right of veto in papal
elections. In September 1774 Clement XIV. died after much
suffering, and the question has been hotly debated ever since
whether poison was the cause of his death. But the latest researches
have shown that there is no evidence to support the
theory of poison. Salicetti, the pope&rsquo;s physician, denied that
the body showed signs of poisoning, and Tanucci, Neapolitan
ambassador at Rome, who had a large share in procuring
the breve of suppression, entirely acquits the Jesuits, while
F. Theiner, no friend to the Society, does the like.</p>

<p>At the date of this suppression, the Society had 41 provinces
and 22,589 members, of whom 11,295 were priests. Far from
submitting to the papal breve, the ex-Jesuits, after some ineffectual
attempts at direct resistance, withdrew into the territories
of the free-thinking sovereigns of Russia and Prussia,
Frederick II. and Catherine II., who became their active friends
and protectors; and the fathers alleged as a principle, in so far as
their theology is concerned, that no papal bull is binding in a
state whose sovereign has not approved and authorized its publication
and execution. Russia formed the headquarters of the
Society, and two forged breves were speedily circulated, being
dated June 9 and June 29, 1774, approving their establishment
in Russia, and implying the repeal of the breve of suppression.
But these are contradicted by the tenor of five genuine breves
issued in September 1774 to the archbishop of Gnesen, and making
certain assurances to the ex-Jesuits, on condition of their complete
obedience to the injunctions already laid on them. The Jesuits
also pleaded a verbal approbation by Pius VI., technically known
as an <i>Oraculum vivae vocis</i>, but this is invalid for purposes of law
unless reduced to writing and duly authenticated.</p>

<p>They elected three Poles successively as generals, taking, however,
only the title of vicars, till on the 7th of March 1801 Pius
VII. granted them liberty to reconstitute themselves in north
Russia, and permitted Kareu, then vicar, to exercise full authority
as general. On the 30th of July 1804 a similar breve restored the
Jesuits in the Two Sicilies, at the express desire of Ferdinand IV.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
the pope thus anticipating the further action of 1814, when, by
the constitution <i>Sollicitudo omnium Ecclesiarum</i>, he revoked the
action of Clement XIV., and formally restored the Society to
corporate legal existence, yet not only omitted any censure of his
predecessor&rsquo;s conduct, but all vindication of the Jesuits from the
heavy charges in the breve <i>Dominus ac Redemptor</i>. In France,
even after their expulsion in 1765, they had maintained a precarious
footing in the country under the partial disguise and
names of &ldquo;Fathers of the Faith&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clerks of the Sacred Heart,&rdquo;
but were obliged by Napoleon I. to retire in 1804. They reappeared
under their true name in 1814, and obtained formal
licence in 1822, but became the objects of so much hostility
that Charles X. deprived them by ordinance of the right of instruction,
and obliged all applicants for licences as teachers to
make oath that they did not belong to any community unrecognized
by the laws. They were dispersed again by the revolution of
July 1830, but soon reappeared and, though put to much inconvenience
during the latter years of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s reign, notably
in 1845, maintained their footing, recovered the right to teach
freely after the revolution of 1848, and gradually became the
leading educational and ecclesiastical power in France, notably
under the Second Empire, till they were once more expelled by
the Ferry laws of 1880, though they quietly returned since the
execution of those measures. They were again expelled by the
Law of Associations of 1901. In Spain they came back with
Ferdinand VII., but were expelled at the constitutional rising in
1820, returning in 1823, when the duke of Angoulême&rsquo;s army
replaced Ferdinand on his throne; they were driven out once
more by Espartero in 1835, and have had no legal position since,
though their presence is openly tolerated. In Portugal, ranging
themselves on the side of Dom Miguel, they fell with his cause,
and were exiled in 1834. There are some to this day in Lisbon
under the name of &ldquo;Fathers of the Faith.&rdquo; Russia, which had
been their warmest patron, drove them from St Petersburg and
Moscow in 1813, and from the whole empire in 1820, mainly
on the plea of attempted proselytizing in the imperial army.
Holland drove them out in 1816, and, by giving them thus a
valid excuse for aiding the Belgian revolution of 1830, secured
them the strong position they have ever since held in Belgium;
but they have succeeded in returning to Holland. They were
expelled from Switzerland in 1847-1848 for the part they were
charged with in exciting the war of the Sonderbund. In south
Germany, inclusive of Austria and Bavaria, their annals since
their restoration have been uneventful; but in north Germany,
owing to the footing Frederick II. had given them in Prussia,
they became very powerful, especially in the Rhine provinces,
and, gradually moulding the younger generation of clergy after
the close of the War of Liberation, succeeded in spreading Ultramontane
views amongst them, and so leading up to the difficulties
with the civil government which issued in the Falk laws,
and their own expulsion by decree of the German parliament
(June 19, 1872). Since then many attempts have been made to
procure the recall of the Society to the German Empire, but
without success, although as individuals they are now allowed in
the country. In Great Britain, whither they began to straggle
over during the revolutionary troubles at the close of the 18th
century, and where, practically unaffected by the clause directed
against them in the Emancipation Act of 1829, their chief settlement
has been at Stonyhurst in Lancashire, an estate conferred
on them by Thomas Weld in 1795, they have been unmolested;
but there has been little affinity to the order in the British
temperament, and the English province has consequently never
risen to numerical or intellectual importance in the Society. In
Rome itself, its progress after the restoration was at first slow, and
it was not till the reign of Leo XII. (1823-1829) that it recovered
its place as the chief educational body there. It advanced
steadily under Gregory XVI., and, though it was at first shunned
by Pius IX., it secured his entire confidence after his return
from Gaeta in 1849, and obtained from him a special breve erecting
the staff of its literary journal, the <i>Civiltà Cattolica</i>, into a
perpetual college under the general of the Jesuits, for the purpose
of teaching and propagating the faith in its pages. How, with
this pope&rsquo;s support throughout his long reign, the gradual filling
of nearly all the sees of Latin Christendom with bishops of their
own selection, and their practical capture, directly or indirectly,
of the education of the clergy in seminaries, they contrived to
stamp out the last remains of independence everywhere, and to
crown the Ultramontane triumph with the Vatican Decrees, is
matter of familiar knowledge. Leo XIII., while favouring them
somewhat, never gave them his full confidence; and by his adhesion
to the Thomist philosophy and theology, and his active
work for the regeneration and progress of the older orders, he
made another suppression possible by destroying much of their
prestige. But the usual sequence has been observed under
Pius X., who appeared to be greatly in favour of the Society and
to rely upon them for many of the measures of his pontificate.</p>

<p>The Society has been ruled by twenty-five generals and four
vicars from its foundation to the present day (1910). Of all the
various nationalities represented in the Society, neither France,
its original cradle, nor England, has ever given it a head, while
Spain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Germany and Poland, were all
represented. The numbers of the Society are not accurately
known, but are estimated at about 20,000, in all parts of the
world; and of these the English, Irish and American Jesuits are
under 3000.</p>

Morgan &amp; Jesup. He became widely known as a financier,
retiring from active business in 1884. He was best known,
however, as a munificent patron of scientific research, a large
contributor to the needs of education, and a public-spirited
citizen of wide interests, who did much for the betterment of
social conditions in New York. He contributed largely to the

<p><span class="bold">JESUS CHRIST.<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> To write a summary account of the life
of Christ, though always involving a grave responsibility, was
until recent years a comparatively straightforward task; for it
was assumed that all that was needed, or could be offered, was a
chronological outline based on a harmony of the four canonical
Gospels. But to-day history is not satisfied by this simple procedure.
Literary criticism has analysed the documents, and has
already established some important results; and many questions
are still in debate, the answers to which must affect our judgment
of the historical value of the existing narratives. It seems
therefore consonant alike with prudence and reverence to refrain
from attempting to combine afresh into a single picture
the materials derivable from the various documents, and to
endeavour instead to describe the main contents of the sources
from which our knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ as an
historical personage is ultimately drawn, and to observe the
picture of Him which each writer in turn has offered to us.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief elements of the evidence with which we shall deal are
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. First, because earliest in point of time, the references to the
Lord Jesus Christ in the earliest Epistles of St Paul.</p>

<p>2. The Gospel according to St Mark.</p>

<p>3. A document, no longer extant, which was partially incorporated
into the Gospels of St Matthew and St Luke.</p>

<p>4. Further information added by St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>

<p>5. Further information added by St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>

<p>6. The Gospel according to St John.</p>

<p class="noind">With regard to traditional sayings or doings of our Lord, which were
only written down at a later period, it will suffice to say that those
which have any claim to be genuine are very scanty, and that their
genuineness has to be tested by their correspondence with the great
bulk of information which is derived from the sources already
enumerated. The fictitious literature of the second and third
centuries, known as the Apocryphal Gospels, offers no direct evidence
of any historical value at all: it is chiefly valuable for the contrast
which it presents to the grave simplicity of the canonical Gospels,
and as showing how incapable a later age was of adding anything to
the Gospel history which was not palpably absurd.</p>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Letters of St Paul.</i>&mdash;In the order of chronology we must give
the first place to the earliest letters of St Paul. The first piece
of Christian literature which has an independent existence and
to which we can fix a date is St Paul&rsquo;s first Epistle to the Thessalonians.
Lightfoot dates it in 52 or 53; Harnack places it
five years earlier. We may say, then, that it was written some
twenty years after the Crucifixion. St Paul is not an historian;
he is not attempting to describe what Jesus Christ said or did.
He is writing a letter to encourage a little Christian society which
he, a Jew, had founded in a distant Greek city; and he reminds
his readers of many things which he had told them when he was
with them. The evidence, to be collected from his epistles
generally must not detain us here, but we may glance for a
moment at this one letter, because it contains what appears to be
the first mention of Jesus Christ in the literature of the world.
Those who would get a true history cannot afford to neglect their
earliest documents. Now the opening sentence of this letter is
as follows: &ldquo;Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the Church of
the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you, and peace.&rdquo; Three men with Greek or Latin
names are writing to some kind of assembly in a city of Macedonia.
The writers are Jews, to judge by their salutation of
&ldquo;peace,&rdquo; and by their mention of &ldquo;God the Father,&rdquo; and of the
assembly or society as being &ldquo;in&rdquo; Him. But what is this new
name which is placed side by side with the Divine Name&mdash;&ldquo;in
God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;? An educated
Greek, who knew something (as many at that time did) of the
Greek translation of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures, if he had
picked up this letter before he had ever heard the name of Jesus
Christ, would have been deeply interested in these opening
words. He would have known that &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; was the Greek
form of Joshua; that &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; was the Greek rendering of
Messiah, or Anointed, the title of the great King for whom the
Jews were looking; he might further have remembered that
&ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is the expression which the Greek Old Testament
constantly uses instead of the ineffable name of God, which we
now call &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>). Who, then, he might well ask
is this Jesus Christ who is lifted to this unexampled height?
For it is plain that Jesus Christ stands in some close relation to
&ldquo;God the Father,&rdquo; and that on the ground of that relation a
society has been built up, apparently by Jews, in a Greek city
far distant from Palestine. He would learn something as he
read on; for the letter makes a passing reference to the foundation
of the society, and to the expansion of its influence in other
parts of Greece; to the conversion of its members from heathenism,
and to the consequent sufferings at the hands of their
heathen neighbours. The writers speak of themselves as
&ldquo;apostles,&rdquo; or messengers, of Christ; they refer to similar
societies &ldquo;in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; which they call &ldquo;churches of God,&rdquo;
in Judaea, and they say that these also suffer from the Jews
there, who had &ldquo;killed the Lord Jesus&rdquo; some time before.
But they further speak of Jesus as &ldquo;raised from the dead,&rdquo;
and they refer to the belief which they had led the society to
entertain, that He would come again &ldquo;from heaven to deliver
them from the coming wrath.&rdquo; Moreover, they urge them
not to grieve for certain members of the society who have already
died, saying that, &ldquo;if we believe that Jesus died and
rose again,&rdquo; we may also be assured that &ldquo;the dead in Christ
will rise&rdquo; and will live for ever with Him. Thus the letter
assumes that its readers already have considerable knowledge
as to &ldquo;the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and as to His relation to &ldquo;God
the Father,&rdquo; a knowledge derived from teaching given in person
on a former visit. The purpose of the letter is not to give information
as to the past, but to stimulate its readers to perseverance
by giving fresh teaching as to the future. Historically
it is of great value as showing how widely within twenty or
twenty-five years of the Crucifixion a religion which proclaimed
developed theological teaching as to &ldquo;the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;
had spread in the Roman Empire. We may draw a further conclusion
from this and other letters of St Paul before we go on.
St Paul&rsquo;s missionary work must have created a demand. Those
who had heard him and read his letters would want to know
more than he had told them of the earthly life of the Lord
Jesus. They would wish to be able to picture Him to their
minds; and especially to understand what could have led to
His being put to death by the Romans at the requisition of the
Jews. St Paul had not been one of his personal disciples in
Galilee or Jerusalem; he had no memories to relate of His
miracles and teaching. Some written account of these was an
obvious need. And we may be sure that any such narrative
concerning One who was so deeply reverenced would be most
carefully scrutinized at a time when many were still living whose
memories went back to the period of Our Lord&rsquo;s public ministry.
One such narrative we now proceed to describe.</p>

<p>2. <i>St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel.</i>&mdash;The Gospel according to St Mark was
written within fifteen years of the first letter of St Paul to the
Thessalonians&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> about 65. It seems designed to meet the
requirements of Christians living far away from Palestine. The
author was not an eye-witness of what he relates, but he writes
with the firm security of a man who has the best authority
behind him. The characteristics of his work confirm the early
belief that St Mark wrote this Gospel for the Christians of Rome
under the guidance of St Peter. It is of the first importance that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
we should endeavour to see this book as a whole; to gain the total
impression which it makes on the mind; to look at the picture of
Jesus Christ which it offers. That picture must inevitably be
an incomplete representation of Him; it will need to be supplemented
by other pictures which other writers have drawn.
But it is important to consider it by itself, as showing us what impress
the Master had made on the memory of one disciple who
had been almost constantly by His side.</p>

<p>The book opens thus: &ldquo;The beginning of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; is shown to be itself rooted
in the past. Hebrew prophets had foretold that
God would send a &ldquo;messenger&rdquo;; that a voice
<span class="sidenote">Beginning of Christ&rsquo;s Mission.</span>
would be heard saying, &ldquo;Prepare the way of the
Lord.&rdquo; And so, in fact, John came, baptizing in the wilderness
and turning the heart of the nation back to God. But John was
only a forerunner. He was himself a prophet, and his prophecy
was this, &ldquo;He that is stronger than I am is coming after me.&rdquo;
Then, we read, &ldquo;Jesus came.&rdquo; St Mark introduces Him quite
abruptly, just as he had introduced John; for he is writing
for those who already know the outlines of the story. &ldquo;Jesus
came from Nazareth of Galilee.&rdquo; He was baptized by John, and
as He came out of the water He had a vision of the opened
heavens and the Holy Spirit, like a dove, descending upon
Him; and He heard a Voice saying, &ldquo;Thou art My Son, the
Beloved: in Thee I am well pleased.&rdquo; He then passed away
into the wilderness, where He was tempted by Satan and fed
by angels. Then He begins His work; and from the very
first we feel that He fulfils John&rsquo;s sign: He is strong. His first
words are words of strength; &ldquo;the time is fulfilled&rdquo;&mdash;that is to
say, all the past has been leading up to this great moment;
&ldquo;the kingdom of God is at hand&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, all your
best hopes are on the point of being fulfilled; &ldquo;repent, and
believe the Gospel&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, turn from your sins and
accept the tidings which I bring you. It is but a brief summary
of what He must have said; but we feel its strength. He does
not hesitate to fix all eyes upon Himself. Then we see Him call
two brothers who are fishermen. &ldquo;Come after Me,&rdquo; He says,
&ldquo;and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo; They dropped their nets
and went after Him, and so did two other brothers, their partners;
for they all felt the power of this Master of men: He was strong.
He began to teach in the synagogue; they were astonished at His
teaching, for he spoke with authority. He was interrupted
by a demoniac, but He quelled the evil spirit by a word; He was
stronger than the power of evil. When the sun set the Sabbath
was at an end, and the people could carry out their sick into
the street where He was; and He came forth and healed them
all. The demoniacs showed a strange faculty of recognition,
and cried that He was &ldquo;the holy one of God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Christ,&rdquo;
but He silenced them at once. The next morning He was
gone. He had sought a quiet spot for prayer. Peter, one of
those fishermen whom He had called, whose wife&rsquo;s mother had
been healed the day before, found Him and tried to bring
Him back. &ldquo;All men are seeking Thee,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Let
us go elsewhere&rdquo; was the quiet reply of one who could not
be moved by popular enthusiasm. Once again, we observe, He
fulfils John&rsquo;s sign: He is strong. This is our first sight of
Jesus Christ. The next shows us that this great strength is
united to a most tender sympathy. To touch a leper was
forbidden, and the offence involved ceremonial defilement. Yet
when a leper declared that Jesus could heal him, if only He
would, &ldquo;He put forth His hand and touched him.&rdquo; The act
perfected the leper&rsquo;s faith, and he was healed immediately.
But he disobeyed the command to be silent about the matter,
and the result was that Jesus could not openly enter into the
town, but remained outside in the country. It is the first shadow
that falls across His path; His power finds a check in human
wilfulness. Presently He is in Capernaum again. He heals a
paralysed man, but not until He has come into touch, as we
say, with him also, by reaching his deepest need and declaring the
forgiveness of his sins. This declaration disturbs the rabbis,
who regard it as a blasphemous usurpation of Divine authority.
But He claims that &ldquo;the Son of Man hath authority on earth to
forgive sins.&rdquo; The title which He thus adopts must be considered
later.</p>

<p>We may note, as we pass on, that He has again, in the
exercise of His power and His sympathy, come into conflict
with the established religious tradition. This freedom
from the trammels of convention appears yet
<span class="sidenote">Attitude towards Religious Tradition.</span>
again when he claims as a new disciple a publican, a
man whose calling as a tax-gatherer for the Roman
government made him odious to every patriotic Jew. Publicans
were classed with open sinners; and when Jesus went to this
man&rsquo;s house and met a company of his fellows the rabbis were
scandalized: &ldquo;Why eateth your Master with publicans and
sinners?&rdquo; The gentle answer of Jesus showed His sympathy even
with those who opposed Him: &ldquo;The doctor,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;must go
to the sick.&rdquo; And again, when they challenged His disciples for
not observing the regular fasts, He gently reminded them that
they themselves relaxed the discipline of fasting for a bridegroom&rsquo;s
friends. And He added, in picturesque and pregnant
sayings, that an old garment could not bear a new patch, and
that old wine-skins could not take new wine. Such language was
at once gentle and strong; without condemning the old, it
claimed liberty for the new. To what lengths would this
liberty go? The sacred badge of the Jews&rsquo; religion, which
marked them off from other men all the world over, was their
observance of the Sabbath. It was a national emblem, the test
of religion and patriotism. The rabbis had fenced the Sabbath
round with minute commands, lest any Jews should even seem
to work on the Sabbath day. Thus, plucking and rubbing the
ears of corn was counted a form of reaping and threshing. The
hungry disciples had so transgressed as they walked through the
fields of ripe corn. Jesus defended them by the example of
David, who had eaten the shewbread, which only priests might
eat, and had given it to his hungry men. Necessity absolves
from ritual restrictions. And he went farther, and proclaimed
a principle: &ldquo;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man
for the Sabbath, so that the Son of Man is lord even of the
Sabbath.&rdquo; For a second time, in justifying His position, He
used the expression &ldquo;the Son of Man.&rdquo; The words might sound
to Jewish ears merely as a synonym for &ldquo;man.&rdquo; For Himself,
and possibly for some others, they involved a reference, as
appears later, to the &ldquo;one like to a son of man&rdquo; in Daniel&rsquo;s
prophecy of the coming kingdom. They emphasized His relation
to humanity as a whole, in contrast to such narrower titles as
&ldquo;Son of Abraham&rdquo; or &ldquo;Son of David.&rdquo; They were fitted to
express a wider mission than that of a merely Jewish Messiah:
He stood and spoke for mankind. The controversy was renewed
when a man with a withered hand appeared in the synagogue
on the Sabbath, and the rabbis watched to see whether Jesus
would heal him. For the first time, we read that Jesus was
angry. They were wilfully blind, and they would rather not
see good done than see it done in a way that contradicted their
teachings and undermined their influence. After a sharp remonstrance,
He healed the man by a mere word. And they went
out to make a compact with the followers of the worldly Herod
to kill Him, and so to stave off a religious revolution which
might easily have been followed by political trouble.</p>

<p>Up to this point what have we seen? On the stage of Palestine,
an outlying district of the Roman Empire, the home of the
Jewish nation, now subject but still fired with the
hope of freedom and even of universal domination
<span class="sidenote">Recapitulation.</span>
under the leadership of a divinely anointed King, a new figure
has appeared. His appearance has been announced by a
reforming prophet, who has summoned the nation to return
to its God, and promised that a stronger than himself is to
follow. In fulfilment of this promise, who is it that has come?
Not a rough prophet in the desert like John, not a leader striking
for political freedom, not a pretender aiming at the petty throne
of the Herods, not even a great rabbi, building on the patriotic
foundation of the Pharisees who had secured the national life
by a new devotion to the ancient law. None of these, but, on the
contrary, an unknown figure from the remote hills of Galilee,
standing on the populous shores of its lake, proclaiming as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
a message from God that the highest hopes were about to be
fulfilled, fastening attention on Himself by speaking with
authority and attaching a few followers to His person, exhibiting
wonderful powers of healing as a sign that He has come to
fulfil all needs, manifesting at the same time an unparalleled
sympathy, and setting quietly aside every religious convention
which limited the outflow of this sympathy; and as the result
of all this arousing the enthusiasm of astonished multitudes and
evoking the opposition and even the murderous resentment
of the religious guides of the nation. Of His teaching we have
heard nothing, except in the occasional sentences by which He
justified some of His unexpected actions. No party is formed,
no programme is announced, no doctrine is formulated; without
assuming the title of Messiah, He offers Himself as the centre of
expectation, and seems to invite an unlimited confidence in
His person. This, then, in brief summary, is what we have seen:
the natural development of an historical situation, a march
of events leading rapidly to a climax; an unexampled strength
and an unexampled sympathy issuing inevitably in an unexampled
liberty; and then the forces of orthodox religion combining
with the forces of worldly indifference in order to suppress
a dangerous innovator. Yet the writer who in a few pages presents
us with so remarkable a representation shows no consciousness
at all of artistic treatment. He tells a simple tale in the
plainest words: he never stops to offer a comment or to point a
moral. The wonder of it all is not in the writing, but in the
subject itself. We feel that we have here no skilful composition,
but a bare transcript of what occurred. And we feel besides
that such a narrative as this is the worthy commencement
of an answer to the question with which its readers would have
come to it: What was the beginning of the Gospel? How
did the Lord Jesus speak and act? and why did He arouse such
malignant enmity amongst His own people?</p>

<p>We have followed St Mark&rsquo;s narrative up to the point at
which it became clear that conciliatory argument could have
no effect upon the Jewish religious leaders. The controversy
about the Sabbath had brought their dissatisfaction to a climax.
Henceforth Jesus was to them a revolutionary, who must, by
any means, be suppressed. After this decisive breach a new
period opens. Jesus leaves Capernaum, never again, it would
seem, to appear in its synagogue. Henceforward He was to be
found, with His disciples, on the shore of the lake, where vast
multitudes gathered round Him, drawn not only from Galilee and
Judaea, but also from the farther districts north and east of
these. He would take refuge from the crowds in a boat, which
carried Him from shore to shore; and His healing activity was
now at its height. Yet in the midst of this popular enthusiasm
He knew that the time had come to prepare for a very different
future, and accordingly a fresh departure was made when He
selected twelve of His disciples for a more intimate companionship,
with a view to a special mission: &ldquo;He appointed twelve
that they might be with Him, and that He might send them
forth to preach and to have power to cast out the devils.&rdquo;
The excitement and pressure of the crowds was at this time
almost overwhelming, and the relatives of Jesus endeavoured to
restrain Him; &ldquo;for they said, He is mad.&rdquo; The scribes from
Jerusalem offered a more sinister explanation, saying that He
was possessed by the prince of the devils, and that this was why
He was able to control all the evil spirits. He answered them
first in figurative language, speaking of the certain downfall
of a kingdom or a family divided against itself, and of the strong
man&rsquo;s house which could not be looted unless the strong man
were first bound. Then followed the tremendous warning, that
to assign His work to Satan, and so to call good evil, was to
blaspheme against the Holy Spirit&mdash;the one sin which admitted
of no forgiveness. Presently, when He was told that His mother
and brethren were calling for Him, He disclaimed their interference
by pointing to a new circle of family relationship, consisting
of all those who &ldquo;do the will of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again we find Him teaching by the lake, and the pressure of
the multitude is still so great that He sits in a boat while they
line the shore. For the first time we are allowed to hear how
He taught them. He gives them a parable from nature&mdash;the
<span class="sidenote">Christ&rsquo;s Teaching.</span>
sower&rsquo;s three kinds of failure, compensated by the rich produce
of the good soil. At the close He utters the pregnant
saying: &ldquo;He that hath ears to hear let him
hear.&rdquo; When His disciples afterwards asked for an explanation,
He prefaced it by saying that the inner circle only
were intended to understand. The disciples might learn that
the message would often prove fruitless, but that nevertheless an
abundant harvest would result. For the light was intended to
shine, and the hidden was meant to be revealed. Another
parable compared the kingdom of God to seed which, when
once planted, must inevitably germinate; the process was
secret and slow, but the harvest was certain. Again, it was
like the tiny mustard-seed which grew out of all proportion
to its original size, till the birds could shelter in its great branches.
These enigmatic speeches were all that the multitudes got,
but the disciples in private were taught their lesson of hope.
As we review this teaching it is very remarkable. The world
of common things is seen to be a lesson-book of the kingdom of
God to those who have eyes to read it. What that kingdom is to
be we are not told; we are only taught that its coming is secret,
slow and certain. If nature in its ordinary processes was thus
seen to be full of significance, the disciples were also to learn
that it was under His control. As the boat from which He had
been teaching passed to the other side, the tired Teacher slept.
A sudden storm terrified the disciples, and they roused Him in
alarm. He stilled the storm with a word and rebuked their
want of faith. &ldquo;Who then is this,&rdquo; they whispered with awe,
&ldquo;that even the wind and the sea obey Him?&rdquo; On the opposite
hills a solitary spectator had watched the rise and the lull of the
tempest, a fierce demoniac who dwelt among the tombs on
the mountain-side. He believed himself to be possessed by a
regiment of demons. When Jesus bade them go forth, he begged
that they might be allowed to enter into a herd of swine which
was hard by. His request was granted, and the swine rushed
over a steep place into the lake. It is worth while to note that
while most of the cures which Jesus had performed appear to
have belonged to this class, this particular case is described as
an exceptionally severe one, and the visible effect of the removal
of his tormentors may have greatly helped to restore the man&rsquo;s
shattered personality.</p>

<p>We must not attempt to trace in detail the whole of St Mark&rsquo;s
story. We have followed it long enough to see its directness and
simplicity, to observe the naturalness with which one incident
succeeds another, and to watch the gradual manifestation of a
personality at once strong and sympathetic, wielding extraordinary
powers, which are placed wholly at the service of others,
and refusing to be hindered from helping men by the ordinary
restrictions of social or religious custom. And we have seen as
the consequence of all this the development of an historical
situation in which the leaders of current orthodoxy ally themselves
with the indifferentism which accepts existing political
conditions in order to put down a disturber of the peace. We
must now be content with a broader survey of the course of
events.</p>

<p>Two notable cures were wrought on the western side of the
lake&mdash;the healing of the woman with the issue and the raising of
Jairus&rsquo;s daughter. In each of these cures prominence
is given to the requirement and the reward of faith&mdash;that
<span class="sidenote">Healing Powers.</span>
is to say, of personal confidence in the Healer: &ldquo;Thy
faith hath made thee whole.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not, only believe.&rdquo;
After this Jesus passed away from the enthusiastic crowds by
the lake to visit His own Nazareth, and to find there a strange
incredulity in regard to one whom the villagers knew as the
carpenter. Once more we come across a mysterious limitation
of His powers: &ldquo;He could not do there any miracle,&rdquo; save the
cure of a few sick folk; and He marvelled because of their want
of faith. The moment had now come when the twelve disciples
were to be entrusted with a share of His healing power and with
the proclamation of repentance. While they are journeying
two and two in various directions St Mark takes occasion to tell
us the current conjectures as to who Jesus really was. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
thought him Elijah or one of the ancient prophets returned to
earth&mdash;a suggestion based on popular tradition; others said He
was John the Baptist risen from the dead&mdash;the superstition
of Herod who had put him to death. When the disciples
returned, Jesus took them apart for rest; but the crowds reassembled
when they found Him again near the lake, and His
yearning compassion for these shepherdless sheep led Him to give
them an impressive sign that He had indeed come to supply all
human needs. Hitherto His power had gone forth to individuals,
but now He fed five thousand men from the scanty stock of five
loaves and two fishes. That night He came to His disciples
walking upon the waters, and in the period which immediately
followed there was once more a great manifestation of healing
power.</p>

<p>We have heard nothing for some time of any opposition; but
now a fresh conflict arose with certain scribes who had come down
from Jerusalem, and who complained that the disciples
neglected the ceremonial washing of their
<span class="sidenote">Opposition of the Scribes.</span>
hands before meals. Jesus replied with a stern rebuke,
addressing the questioners as hypocrites, and exposing the
falsity of a system which allowed the breach of fundamental
commandments in order that traditional regulations might be
observed. He then turned from them to the multitude, and
uttered a saying which in effect annulled the Jewish distinction
between clean and unclean meats. This was a direct attack on
the whole Pharisaic position. The controversy was plainly
irreconcilable, and Jesus withdrew to the north, actually passing
outside the limits of the Holy Land. He desired to remain
unknown, and not to extend His mission to the heathen population,
but the extraordinary faith and the modest importunity of
a Syrophenician woman induced Him to heal her daughter.
Then He returned by a circuitous route to the Sea of Galilee.
His return was marked by another miraculous feeding of the
multitude, and also by two healing miracles which present
unusual features. In both the patient was withdrawn from the
multitude and the cure was wrought with the accompaniment of
symbolic actions. Moreover, in one case Jesus is described as
groaning before He spoke; in the other the cure was at first incomplete;
and both of the men were strictly charged to observe
silence afterwards. It cannot be a mere coincidence that these
are the last cures which St Mark records as performed in Galilee.</p>

<p>In fact the Galilean ministry is now closed. Jesus retires
northwards to Caesarea Philippi, and appears henceforth to
devote Himself entirely to the instruction of his disciples,
who needed to be prepared for the fatal issue
<span class="sidenote">Messianic Teaching.</span>
which could not long be delayed. He begins by asking them
the popular opinion as to His Person. The suggestions are
still the same&mdash;John the Baptist, or Elijah, or some other of
the prophets. But when He asked their own belief, Peter
replied, &ldquo;Thou art the Christ.&rdquo; He warned them not to make
this known; and He proceeded to give them the wholly new
teaching that the Son of Man must suffer and be killed, adding
that after three days He must rise again. Peter took Him aside
and urged Him not to speak so. But He turned to the other
disciples and openly rebuked Peter. And then, addressing a yet
wider circle, He demanded of those who should follow Him a
self-sacrifice like His own. He even used the metaphor of the
cross which was carried by the sufferer to the place of execution.
Life, he declared, could only be saved by voluntary death. He
went on to demand an unswerving loyalty to Himself and His
teaching in the face of a threatening world; and then He promised
that some of those who were present should not die before they
had seen the coming of the kingdom of God. We have had no
hint of such teaching as this in the whole of the Galilean ministry.
Jesus had stood forth as the strong healer and helper of men; it
was bewildering to hear Him speak of dying. He had promised
to fulfil men&rsquo;s highest expectations, if only they would not
doubt His willingness and power. He had been enthusiastically
reverenced by the common people, though suspected and attacked
by the religious leaders. He had spoken of &ldquo;the will of God&rdquo;
as supreme, and had set aside ceremonial traditions. He had
announced the nearness of the kingdom of God, but had
described it only in parables from nature. He had adopted the
vague title of the &ldquo;Son of Man,&rdquo; but had refrained from proclaiming
Himself as the expected Messiah. At last the disciples
had expressed their conviction that He was the Christ, and immediately
He tells them that He goes to meet humiliation and death
as the necessary steps to a resurrection and a coming of the Son
of Man in the glory of His Father. It was an amazing announcement
and He plainly added that their path like His own lay
through death to life. The dark shadows of this picture of the
future alone could impress their minds, but a week later three of
them were allowed a momentary vision of the light which should
overcome the darkness. They saw Jesus transfigured in a
radiance of glory: Elijah appeared with Moses, and they talked
with Jesus. A cloud came over them, and a Voice, like that of
the Baptism, proclaimed &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved: hear
ye Him.&rdquo; They were bidden to keep the vision secret till the
Son of Man should have risen from the dead. It was in itself a
foretaste of resurrection, and the puzzled disciples remembered
that the scribes declared that before the resurrection Elijah
would appear. Their minds were confused as to what resurrection
was meant. Jesus told them that Elijah had in fact come;
and He also said that the Scriptures foretold the sufferings of
the Son of Man. But the situation was wholly beyond their
grasp, and the very language of St Mark at this point seems to
reflect the confusion of their minds.</p>

<p>The other disciples, in the meantime, had been vainly endeavouring
to cure a peculiarly violent case of demoniacal
possession. Jesus Himself cast out the demon, but not before
the suffering child had been rendered seemingly lifeless by a
final assault. Then they journeyed secretly through Galilee
towards Judaea and the eastern side of the Jordan. On the way
Jesus reinforced the new lesson of self-renunciation. He offered
the little children as the type of those to whom the kingdom of
God belonged; and He disappointed a young and wealthy aspirant
to His favour, amazing His disciples by saying that the
kingdom of God could hardly be entered by the rich; he who
forsook all should have all, and more than all; the world&rsquo;s
estimates were to be reversed&mdash;the first should be last and the
last first. They were now journeying towards Jerusalem, and
the prediction of the Passion was repeated. James and John,
who had witnessed the Transfiguration, and who were confident
of the coming glory, asked for the places nearest to their Master,
and professed their readiness to share His sufferings. When
the other ten were aggrieved Jesus declared that greatness was
measured by service, not by rank; and that the Son of Man had
come not to be served but to serve, and to give His life to
ransom many other lives. As they came up from the Jordan
valley and passed through Jericho, an incident occurred which
signalized the beginning of the final period. A blind man
appealed to Jesus as &ldquo;the Son of David,&rdquo; and was answered
by the restoration of his sight; and when, a little later, Jesus
fulfilled an ancient prophecy by mounting an ass and riding into
Jerusalem, the multitudes snouted their welcome to the returning
&ldquo;kingdom of David.&rdquo; Hitherto He had not permitted any
public recognition of His Messiahship, but now He entered
David&rsquo;s city in lowly but significant pomp as David&rsquo;s promised
heir.</p>

<p>Two incidents illustrate the spirit of judgment with which He
approached the splendid but apostate city. On His arrival He
had carefully observed the condition of the Temple,
and had retired to sleep outside the city. On the
<span class="sidenote">Entry into Jerusalem.</span>
following morning, finding no fruit on a fig-tree in full leaf,
He said, &ldquo;Let no man eat fruit of thee henceforth for ever.&rdquo; It
was a parable of impending doom. Then, when He entered
the Temple, He swept away with a fiery zeal the merchants and
merchandise which had turned God&rsquo;s House into &ldquo;a robbers&rsquo;
den.&rdquo; The act was at once an assertion of commanding authority
and an open condemnation of the religious rulers who
had permitted the desecration. Its immediate effect was to
make new and powerful enemies; for the chief priests, as well as
their rivals the scribes, were now inflamed against Him. At the
moment they could do nothing, but the next day they formally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
demanded whence He derived His right so to act. When they
refused to answer His question as to the authority of John the
Baptist, He in turn refused to tell them His own. But He
uttered a parable which more than answered them. The owner
of the vineyard, who had sent his servants and last of all his only
son, would visit their rejection and murder on the wicked
husbandmen. He added a reminder that the stone which the
builders refused was, after all, the Divine choice. They were
restrained from arresting Him by fear of the people, to whom
the meaning of the parable was plain. They therefore sent a
joint deputation of Pharisees and Herodians to entrap Him
with a question as to the Roman tribute, in answering which He
must either lose His influence with the people or else lay Himself
open to a charge of treason. When they were baffled, the
Sadducees, to whose party the chief priests belonged, sought in
vain to pose Him with a problem as to the resurrection of the
dead; and after that a more honest scribe confessed the truth
of His teaching as to the supremacy of love to God and man over
all the sacrificial worship of the Temple, and was told in reply
that he was not far from the kingdom of God. Jesus Himself
now put a question as to the teaching of the scribes which
identified the Messiah with &ldquo;the Son of David&rdquo;; and then
He denounced those scribes whose pride and extortion and
hypocrisy were preparing for them a terrible doom. Before He
left the Temple, never to return, one incident gave Him pure
satisfaction. His own teaching that all must be given for God
was illustrated by the devotion of a poor widow who cast into
the treasury the two tiny coins which were all that she had.
As He passed out He foretold, in words which corresponded to
the doom of the fig-tree, the utter demolition of the imposing
but profitless Temple; and presently He opened up to four of
His disciples a vision of the future, warning them against false
Christs, bidding them expect great sorrows, national and
personal, declaring that the gospel must be proclaimed to all
the nations, and that after a great tribulation the Son of Man
should appear, &ldquo;coming with the clouds of heaven.&rdquo; The day
and the hour none knew, neither the angels nor the Son, but
only the Father: it was the duty of all to watch.</p>

<p>We now come to the final scenes. The passover was approaching,
and plots were being laid for His destruction. He Himself
spoke mysteriously of His burial, when a woman
poured a vase of costly ointment upon His head.
<span class="sidenote">Final Scenes.</span>
To some this seemed a wasteful act; but He accepted it as
a token of the love which gave all that was in its power, and
He promised that it should never cease to illustrate His Gospel.
Two of the disciples were sent into Jerusalem to prepare the
Passover meal. During the meal Jesus declared that He should
be betrayed by one of their number. Later in the evening He
gave them bread and wine, proclaiming that these were His body
and His blood&mdash;the tokens of His giving Himself to them, and
of a new covenant with God through His death. As they withdrew
to the Mount of Olives He foretold their general flight, but
promised that when He was risen He would go before them into
Galilee. Peter protested faithfulness unto death, but was told
that he would deny his Master three times that very night.
Then coming to a place called Gethsemane, He bade the disciples
wait while He should pray; and taking the three who had been
with Him at the Transfiguration He told them to tarry near
Him and to watch. He went forward, and fell on the ground,
praying that &ldquo;the cup might be taken away&rdquo; from Him, but
resigning Himself to His Father&rsquo;s will. Presently Judas arrived
with a band of armed men, and greeted his Master with a kiss&mdash;the
signal for His arrest. The disciples fled in panic, after one
of them had wounded the high priest&rsquo;s servant. Only a nameless
young man tried to follow, but he too fled when hands were laid
upon him. Before the high priest Jesus was charged, among
other accusations, with threatening to destroy the Temple; but
the matter was brought to an issue when He was plainly asked
if He were &ldquo;the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One.&rdquo; He
answered that He was, and He predicted that they should see
the fulfilment of Daniel&rsquo;s vision of the Son of Man sitting on the
right hand of power. Thereupon He was condemned to death
for manifest blasphemy, and a scene of cruel mockery followed.
Meanwhile Peter in the court below had been sitting with the
servants, and in his anxiety to escape recognition had thrice
declared that he did not know Jesus. Thus the night passed,
and in the morning Jesus was taken to Pilate, for the Jewish
council had no power to execute their decree of death. Pilate&rsquo;s
question, &ldquo;Art Thou the King of the Jews?&rdquo; shows the nature
of the accusation which was thought likely to tell with the
Roman governor. He had already in bonds one leader of
revolution, whose hands were stained with blood&mdash;a striking
contrast to the calm and silent figure who stood before him. At
this moment a crowd came up to ask the fulfilment of his annual
act of grace, the pardon of a prisoner at the Passover. Pilate,
discerning that it was the envy of the rulers which sought to
destroy an inconvenient rival, offered &ldquo;the King of the Jews&rdquo;
as the prisoner to be released. But the chief priests succeeded
in making the people ask for Barabbas and demand the crucifixion
of Jesus. Pilate fulfilled his pledge by giving them the
man of their choice, and Jesus, whom he had vainly hoped to
release on a satisfactory pretext, he now condemned to the
shameful punishments of scourging and crucifixion; for the
cross, as Jesus had foreseen, was the inevitable fate of a Jewish
pretender to sovereignty. The Roman soldiers mocked &ldquo;the
King of the Jews&rdquo; with a purple robe and a crown of thorns.
As they led Him out they forced the cross, which the sufferer
commonly carried, upon the shoulders of one Simon of Cyrene,
whose son&rsquo;s Alexander and Rufus are here mentioned&mdash;probably
as being known to St Mark&rsquo;s readers; at any rate, it is interesting
to note that, in writing to the Christians at Rome, St Paul a
few years earlier had sent a greeting to &ldquo;Rufus and his mother.&rdquo;
Over the cross, which stood between two others, was the condemnatory
inscription, &ldquo;The King of the Jews.&rdquo; This was the
Roman designation of Him whom the Jewish rulers tauntingly
addressed as &ldquo;the King of Israel.&rdquo; The same revilers, with a
deeper truth than they knew, summed up the mystery of His
life and death when they said, &ldquo;He saved others, Himself He
cannot save.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great darkness shrouded the scene for three hours, and then,
in His native Aramaic, Jesus cried in the words of the Psalm,
&ldquo;My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?&rdquo; One other
cry He uttered, and the end came, and at that moment the veil
of the Temple was rent from top to bottom&mdash;an omen of fearful
import to those who had mocked Him, even on the cross, as the
destroyer of the Temple, who in three days should build it anew.
The disciples of Jesus do not appear as spectators of the end, but
only a group of women who had ministered to His needs in
Galilee, and had followed Him up to Jerusalem. These women
watched His burial, which was performed by a Jewish councillor,
to whom Pilate had granted the body after the centurion had
certified the reality of the unexpectedly early death. The body
was placed in a rock-hewn tomb, and a great stone was rolled
against the entrance. Sunset brought on the Jewish sabbath,
but the next evening the women brought spices to anoint the
body, and at sunrise on the third day they arrived at the tomb,
and saw that the stone was rolled away. They entered and
found a young man in a white robe, who said, &ldquo;He is risen, He
is not here,&rdquo; and bade them say to His disciples and Peter, &ldquo;He
goeth before you into Galilee; there ye shall see Him, as He said
unto you.&rdquo; In terror they fled from the tomb, &ldquo;and they said
nothing to any man, for they feared....&rdquo;</p>

<p>So with a broken sentence the narrative ends. The document
is imperfect, owing probably to the accidental loss of its last
leaf. In very early times attempts were made to furnish it with
a fitting close; but neither of the supplements which we find in
manuscripts can be regarded as coming from the original writer.
If we ask what must, on grounds of literary probability, have
been added before the record was closed, we may content ourselves
here with saying that some incident must certainly have
been narrated which should have realized the twice-repeated
promise that Jesus would be seen by His disciples in Galilee.</p>

<p>3. <i>Document used by St Matthew and St Luke.</i>&mdash;We pass on now
to compare with this narrative of St Mark another very early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>
document which no longer exists in an independent form, but
which can be partially reconstructed from the portions of it
which have been embodied in the Gospels of St Matthew and
St Luke.</p>

<p>When we review St Mark&rsquo;s narrative as a whole we are struck,
first of all, with its directness and simplicity. It moves straightforward
upon a well-defined path. It shows us the Lord Jesus
entering on the mission predicted by the Baptist without declaring
Himself to be the Messiah; attracting the multitudes
in Galilee by His healing power and His unbounded sympathy,
and at the same time awakening the envy and suspicion of the
leaders of religion; training a few disciples till they reach the
conviction that He is the Christ, and then, but not till then,
admitting them into the secret of His coming sufferings, and
preparing them for a mission in which they also must sacrifice
themselves; then journeying to Jerusalem to fulfil the destiny
which He foresaw, accepting the responsibility of the Messianic
title, only to be condemned by the religious authorities as a
blasphemer and handed over to the Roman power as a pretender
to the Jewish throne. That is the story in its barest outline.
It is adequate to its presumed purpose of offering to distant
Gentile converts a clear account of their Master&rsquo;s earthly work,
and of the causes which led to His rejection by His own people
and to His death by Roman crucifixion. The writer makes no
comment on the wonderful story which he tells. Allusions to
Jewish customs are, indeed, explained as they occur, but apart
from this the narrative appears to be a mere transcript of
remembered facts. The actors are never characterized; their
actions are simply noted down; there is no praise and no blame.
To this simplicity and directness of narrative we may in large
measure attribute the fact that when two later evangelists
desired to give fuller accounts of our Lord&rsquo;s life they both
made this early book the basis of their work. In those days
there was no sense of unfairness in using up existing materials
in order to make a more complete treatise. Accordingly so
much of St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel has been taken over word for word in
the Gospels of St Luke and St Matthew that, if every copy of it
had perished, we could still reconstruct large portions of it by
carefully comparing their narratives. They did not hesitate,
however, to alter St Mark&rsquo;s language where it seemed to them
rough or obscure, for each of them had a distinctive style of his
own, and St Luke was a literary artist of a high order. Moreover,
though they both accepted the general scheme of St Mark&rsquo;s
narrative, each of them was obliged to omit many incidents in
order to find room for other material which was at their disposal,
by which they were able to supplement the deficiencies of the
earlier book. The most conspicuous deficiency was in regard
to our Lord&rsquo;s teaching, of which, as we have seen, St Mark had
given surprisingly little. Here they were happily in a position
to make a very important contribution.</p>

<p>For side by side with St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel there was current in
the earliest times another account of the doings and sayings of
Jesus Christ. Our knowledge of it to-day is entirely derived
from a comparison of the two later evangelists who embodied
large portions of it, working it in and out of the general scheme
which they derived from St Mark, according as each of them
thought most appropriate. St Luke appears to have taken it
over in sections for the most part without much modification;
but in St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel its incidents seldom find an independent
place; the sayings to which they gave rise are often detached
from their context and grouped with sayings of a similar character
so as to form considerable discourses, or else they are linked on
to sayings which were uttered on other occasions recorded by
St Mark. It is probable that many passages of St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel
which have no parallel in St Matthew were also derived from
this early source; but this is not easily capable of distinct proof;
and, therefore, in order to gain a secure conception of the document
we must confine ourselves at first to those parts of it which
were borrowed by both writers. We shall, however, look to
St Luke in the main as preserving for us the more nearly its
original form.</p>

<p>We proceed now to give an outline of the contents of this
document. To begin with, it contained a fuller account of the
teaching of John the Baptist. St Mark tells us only his message
of hope; but here we read the severer language with which he
called men to repentance. We hear his warning of &ldquo;the coming
wrath&rdquo;: his mighty Successor will baptize with fire; the fruitless
tree will be cast into the fire; the chaff will be separated from the
wheat and burned with unquenchable fire; the claim to be
children of Abraham will not avail, for God can raise up other
children to Abraham, if it be from the stones of the desert.
Next, we have a narrative of the Temptation, of which St Mark
had but recorded the bare fact. It was grounded on the
Divine sonship, which we already know was proclaimed at the
Baptism. In a threefold vision Jesus is invited to enter upon
His inheritance at once; to satisfy His own needs, to accept of
earthly dominion, to presume on the Divine protection. The
passage stands almost alone as a revelation of inner conflict in a
life which outwardly was marked by unusual calm.</p>

<p>Not far from the beginning of the document there stood a
remarkable discourse delivered among the hills above the lake.
It opens with a startling reversal of the common estimates
of happiness and misery. In the light of the
<span class="sidenote">The Sermon on the Mount.</span>
coming kingdom it proclaims the blessedness of the
poor, the hungry, the sad and the maligned; and the <span class="correction" title="amended from wofulness">woefulness</span>
of the rich, the full, the merry and the popular. It goes on to
reverse the ordinary maxims of conduct. Enemies are to be
loved, helped, blessed, prayed for. No blow is to be returned;
every demand, just or unjust, is to be granted: in short, &ldquo;as
ye desire that men should do to you, do in like manner to them.&rdquo;
Then the motive and the model of this conduct are adduced:
&ldquo;Love your enemies ... and ye shall be sons of the Highest;
for He is kind to the thankless and wicked. Be merciful, as
your Father is merciful; and judge not, and ye shall not be
judged.&rdquo; We note in passing that this is the first introduction
of our Lord&rsquo;s teaching of the fatherhood of God. God is your
Father, He says in effect; you will be His sons if like Him you
will refuse to make distinctions, loving without looking for a
return, sure that in the end love will not be wholly lost. Then
follow grave warnings&mdash;generous towards others, you must be
strict with yourselves; only the good can truly do good; hearers
of these words must be doers also, if they would build on the
rock and not on the sand. So, with the parable of the two
builders, the discourse reached its formal close.</p>

<p>It was followed by the entry of Jesus into Capernaum, where
He was asked to heal the servant of a Roman officer. This
man&rsquo;s unusual faith, based on his soldierly sense of discipline,
surprised the Lord, who declared that it had no equal in Israel
itself. Somewhat later messengers arrived from the imprisoned
Baptist, who asked if Jesus were indeed &ldquo;the coming One&rdquo;
of whom he had spoken. Jesus pointed to His acts of healing
the sick, raising the dead and proclaiming good news for the poor;
thereby suggesting to those who could understand that He fulfilled
the ancient prophecy of the Messiah. He then declared
the greatness of John in exalted terms, adding, however, that the
least in the kingdom of God was John&rsquo;s superior. Then He
complained of the unreasonableness of an age which refused
John as too austere and Himself as too lax and as being &ldquo;the
friend of publicans and sinners.&rdquo; This narrative clearly presupposes
a series of miracles already performed, and also such a
conflict with the Pharisees as we have seen recorded by St Mark.
Presently we find an offer of discipleship met by the warning
that &ldquo;the Son of Man&rdquo; is a homeless wanderer; and then the
stern refusal of a request for leave to perform a father&rsquo;s funeral
rites.</p>

<p>Close upon these incidents follows a special mission of disciples,
introduced by the saying: &ldquo;The harvest is great, but the
labourers are few.&rdquo; The disciples as they journey
are to take no provisions, but to throw themselves
<span class="sidenote">Other Sayings of Jesus.</span>
on the bounty of their hearers; they are to heal the
sick and to proclaim the nearness of the kingdom of God.
The city that rejects them shall have a less lenient judgment
than Sodom; Tyre and Sidon shall be better off than cities
like Chorazin and Bethsaida which have seen His miracles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
Capernaum, favoured above all, shall sink to the deepest depth.
If words could be sterner than these, they are those which
follow: &ldquo;He that heareth you heareth Me; and he that rejecteth
you rejecteth Me; but He that rejecteth Me rejecteth Him that
sent Me.&rdquo; This reference to His own personal mission is strikingly
expanded in words which He uttered on the return of the
disciples. After thanking the Father for revealing to babes
what He hides from the wise, He continued in mysterious
language: &ldquo;All things are delivered to Me by My Father; and
none knoweth who the Son is but the Father; and who the
Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son chooseth to
reveal Him.&rdquo; Happy were the disciples in seeing and hearing
what prophets and kings had looked for in vain.</p>

<p>When His disciples, having watched Him at prayer, desired
to be taught how to pray, they were bidden to address God as
&ldquo;Father&rdquo;; to ask first for the hallowing of the Father&rsquo;s name,
and the coming of His kingdom; then for their daily food, for
the pardon of their sins and for freedom from temptation. It
was the prayer of a family&mdash;that the sons might be true to the
Father, and the Father true to the sons; and they were further
encouraged by a parable of the family: &ldquo;Ask and ye shall
receive.... Every one that asketh receiveth&rdquo;: for the heavenly
Father will do more, not less, than an earthly father would do for
his children. After He had cast out a dumb demon, some said
that His power was due to Beelzebub. He accordingly asked
them by whom the Jews themselves cast out demons; and He
claimed that His power was a sign that the kingdom of God was
come. But He warned them that demons cast out once might
return in greater force. When they asked for a sign from heaven,
He would give them no more than the sign of Jonah, explaining
that the repentant Ninevites should condemn the present
generation: so, too, should the queen of Sheba; for that which
they were now rejecting was more than Jonah and more than
Solomon. Yet further warnings were given when a Pharisee
invited Him to his table, and expressed surprise that He did not
wash His hands before the meal. The cleansing of externals and
the tithing of garden-produce, He declares, have usurped the
place of judgment and the love of God. Woe is pronounced
upon the Pharisees: they are successors to the murderers of
the prophets. Then citing from Genesis and 2 Chronicles, the
first and last books in the order of the Jewish Bible, He declared
that all righteous blood from that of Abel to that of Zachariah
should be required of that generation. After this the disciples
are encouraged not to fear their murderous opponents. The
very sparrows are God&rsquo;s care&mdash;much more shall they be; the
hairs of their head are all counted. In the end the Son of Man
will openly own those who have owned Him before men. For
earthly needs no thought is to be taken: the birds and the
flowers make no provision for their life and beauty. God will
give food and raiment to those who are seeking His kingdom.
Earthly goods should be given away in exchange for the
imperishable treasures. Suddenly will the Son of Man come:
happy the servant whom His Master finds at his appointed task.
In brief parables the kingdom of God is likened to a mustard-seed
and to leaven. When Jesus is asked if the saved shall be
few, He replies that the door is a narrow one. Then, changing
His illustration, He says that many shall seek entrance in vain;
for the master of the house will refuse to recognize them. But
while they are excluded, a multitude from all quarters of the
earth shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the
prophets in the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>His eyes are now fixed on Jerusalem, where, like the prophets,
He must die. &ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often have I desired
to gather thy children together, as a bird her brood beneath her
wings, but ye refused.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye shall not see Me, until ye shall say,
Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.&rdquo; After this
we have the healing of a dropsical man on the Sabbath, with a
reply to the murmuring Pharisees; and then a parable of the
failure of invited guests and the filling of their places from the
streets. A few fragmentary passages remain, of which it will be
sufficient to cite a word or two to call them to remembrance.
There is a warning that he who forsakes not father and mother
cannot be a disciple, nor he who does not bear his cross. Savourless
salt is fit for nothing. The lost sheep is brought home with
a special joy. &ldquo;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.&rdquo; Scandals
must arise, but woe to him through whom they arise. The Son
of Man will come with the suddenness of lightning; the days of
Noah and the days of Lot will find a parallel in their blind gaiety
and their inevitable disaster. He who seeks to gain his life will
lose it. &ldquo;One shall be taken, and the other left.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where
the carcase is, the vultures will gather.&rdquo; Then, lastly, we have
a parable of the servant who failed to employ the money entrusted
to him; and a promise that the disciples shall sit on
twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. We cannot
say by our present method of determination, how this document
closed; for in the narratives of the Passion and the Resurrection
St Matthew and St Luke only coincide in passages which they
have taken from St Mark.</p>

<p>Now that we have reconstructed in outline this early account
of the Lord Jesus, so far as it has been used by both the later
evangelists, we may attempt to compare the picture
which it presents to us with that which was offered
<span class="sidenote">Comparison with St Mark.</span>
by St Mark. But in doing so we must remember
that we know it only in fragments. There can be little doubt
that much more of it is embedded in St Luke&rsquo;s Gospel, and
something more also in St Matthew&rsquo;s; but in order to stand on
firm ground we have considered thus far only those portions
which both of these writers elected to use in composing
their later narratives. To go beyond this is a work of delicate
discrimination. It can only be effected by a close examination
of the style and language of the document, which may enable us
in some instances to identify with comparative security certain
passages which are found in St Luke, but which St Matthew did
not regard as suitable for his purpose. Among these we may
venture, quite tentatively, to mention the sermon at Nazareth
which opened with a passage from the Book of Isaiah, the raising
of the widow&rsquo;s son at Nain, and the parable of the good Samaritan.
These are found in St Luke, but not in St Matthew. On
the other hand, it is not improbable that the wonderful words
which begin, &ldquo;Come unto Me all ye that labour,&rdquo; were drawn
by St Matthew from the same document, though they are not
recorded by St Luke. But here we have entered upon a region
of less certainty, in which critical scholarship has still much to do;
and these passages are mentioned here only as a reminder that
the document must have contained more than what St Matthew
and St Luke each independently determined to borrow from it.
Looking, then, at the portions which we have indicated as having
this two-fold testimony, we see that in their fragmentary condition
we cannot trace the clear historical development which
was so conspicuous a feature of St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel; yet we need
not conclude that in its complete form it failed to present an
orderly narrative. Next, we see that wherever we are able to
observe its method of relating an incident, as in the case of the
healing of the centurion&rsquo;s servant, we have the same characteristics
of brevity and simplicity which we admired in St Mark.
No comment is made by the narrator; he tells his tale in the
fewest words and passes on. Again, we note that it supplies
just what we feel we most need when we have reached the end
of St Mark&rsquo;s story, a fuller account of the teaching which Jesus
gave to His disciples and to the people at large. And we see
that the substance of that teaching is in complete harmony
with the scattered hints that we found in St Mark. If the fatherhood
of God stands out clearly, we may remember a passage of
St Mark also which speaks of &ldquo;the Heavenly Father&rdquo; as forgiving
those who forgive. If prayer is encouraged, we may also
remember that the same passage of St Mark records the saying:
&ldquo;All things whatsoever ye pray for and ask, believe that ye
have received them and ye shall have them.&rdquo; If in one mysterious
passage Jesus speaks of &ldquo;the Father&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Son&rdquo;&mdash;terms
with which the Gospel of St John has made us familiar&mdash;St Mark
also in one passage uses the same impressive terms&mdash;&ldquo;the Son&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the Father.&rdquo; There are, of course, many
other parallels with St Mark, and at some points the two documents
seem to overlap and to relate the same incidents in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
somewhat different forms. There is the same use of parables
from nature, the same incisiveness of speech and employment of
paradox, the same demand to sacrifice all to Him and for His
cause, the same importunate claim made by Him on the human
soul.</p>

<p>But the contrast between the two writers is even more important
for our purpose. No one can read through the passages to
which we have pointed without feeling the solemn
sternness of the great Teacher, a sternness which can
<span class="sidenote">The Element of Warning.</span>
indeed be traced here and there in St Mark, but which
does not give its tone to the whole of his picture. Here
we see Christ standing forth in solitary grandeur, looking
with the eyes of another world on a society which is blindly
hastening to its dissolution. It may be that if this document
had come down to us in its entirety, we should have gathered
from it an exaggerated idea of the severity of our Lord&rsquo;s character.
Certain it is that as we read over these fragments we are
somewhat startled by the predominance of the element of warning,
and by the assertion of rules of conduct which seem almost
inconsistent with a normal condition of settled social life. The
warning to the nation sounded by the Baptist, that God could
raise up a new family for Abraham, is heard again and again in
our Lord&rsquo;s teaching. Gentile faith puts Israel to shame. The
sons of the kingdom will be left outside, while strangers feast
with Abraham. Capernaum shall go to perdition; Jerusalem
shall be a desolate ruin. The doom of the nation is pronounced;
its fate is imminent; there is no ray of hope for the existing constitution
of religion and society. As to individuals within the
nation, the despised publicans and sinners will find God&rsquo;s favour
before the self-satisfied representatives of the national religion.
In such a condition of affairs it is hardly surprising to find that
the great and stern Teacher congratulates the poor and has
nothing but pity for the rich; that He has no interest at all in
comfort or property. If a man asks you for anything, give it him;
if he takes it without asking, do not seek to recover it. Nothing
material is worth a thought; anxiety is folly; your Father, who
feeds His birds and clothes His flowers, will feed and clothe you.
Rise to the height of your sonship to God; love your enemies even
as God loves His; and if they kill you, God will care for you still;
fear them not, fear only Him who loves you all.</p>

<p>Here is a new philosophy of life, offering solid consolation
amid the ruin of a world. We have no idea who the disciple
may have been who thus seized upon the sadder elements of
the teaching of Jesus; but we may well think of him as one of
those who were living in Palestine in the dark and threatening
years of internecine strife, when the Roman eagles were gathering
round their prey, and the first thunder was muttering of the
storm which was to leave Jerusalem a heap of stones. At such a
moment the warnings of our Lord would claim a large place in a
record of His teaching, and the strange comfort which He had
offered would be the only hope which it would seem possible to
entertain.</p>

<p>4. <i>Additions by the Gospel according to St Matthew.</i>&mdash;We have
now examined in turn the two earliest pictures which have been
preserved to us of the life of Jesus Christ. The first
portrays Him chiefly by a record of His actions,
<span class="sidenote">The Earlier Narratives.</span>
and illustrates His strength, His sympathy, and His
freedom from conventional restraints. It shows the disturbing
forces of these characteristics, which aroused the envy and apprehension
of the leaders of religion. The first bright days of welcome
and popularity are soon clouded: the storm begins to lower.
More and more the Master devotes Himself to the little circle
of His disciples, who are taught that they, as well as He, can only
triumph through defeat, succeed by failure, and find their life in
giving it away. At length, in fear of religious innovations and
pretending that He is a political usurper, the Jews deliver Him
up to die on a Roman cross. The last page of the story is torn
away, just at the point when it has been declared that He is
alive again and about to show Himself to His disciples. The
second picture has a somewhat different tone. It is mainly a
record of teaching, and the teaching is for the most part stern
and paradoxical. It might be described as revolutionary. It is
good tidings to the poor: it sets no store on property and material
comfort: it pities the wealthy and congratulates the needy. It
reverses ordinary judgments and conventional maxims of conduct.
It proclaims the downfall of institutions, and compares the
present blind security to the days of Noah and of Lot: a few only
shall escape the coming overthrow. Yet even in this sterner
setting the figure portrayed is unmistakably the same. There is
the same strength, the same tender sympathy, the same freedom
from convention: there is the same promise to fulfil the highest
hopes, the same surrender of life, and the same imperious demand
on the lives of others. No thoughtful man who examines and
compares these pictures can doubt that they are genuine historical
portraits of a figure wholly different from any which had hitherto
appeared on the world&rsquo;s stage. They are beyond the power
of human invention. They are drawn with a simplicity which is
their own guarantee. If we had these, and these only, we should
have an adequate explanation of the beginnings of Christianity.
There would still be a great gap to be filled before we reached the
earliest letters of St Paul; but yet we should know what the
Apostle meant when he wrote to &ldquo;the Church of the Thessalonians
in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and reminded
them how they had &ldquo;turned from idols to serve the living and
true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised
from the dead, even Jesus who delivereth us from the wrath to
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If these two narratives served the first needs of Christian
believers, it is easy to see that they would presently stimulate
further activity in the same direction. For, to begin with, they
were obviously incomplete: many incidents and teachings known
to the earliest disciples found no place in them; and they contained
no account of the life of Jesus Christ before His public
ministry, no record of His pedigree, His birth or His childhood.
Secondly, their form left much to be desired; for one of them at
least was rude in style, sometimes needlessly repetitive and sometimes
brief to obscurity. Moreover the very fact that there were
two challenged a new and combined work which perhaps should
supersede both.</p>

<p>Accordingly, some years after the fall of Jerusalem&mdash;we
cannot tell the exact date or the author&rsquo;s name&mdash;the book
which we call the Gospel according to St Matthew
was written to give the Palestinian Christians a
<span class="sidenote">The Gospel of St Matthew.</span>
full account of Jesus Christ, which should present
Him as the promised Messiah, fulfilling the ancient Hebrew
prophecies, proclaiming the kingdom of heaven, and founding
the Christian society. The writer takes St Mark as his
basis, but he incorporates into the story large portions of
the teaching which he has found in the other document. He
groups his materials with small regard to chronological order;
and he fashions out of the many scattered sayings of our Lord
continuous discourses, everywhere bringing like to like, with
considerable literary art. A wide knowledge of the Old Testament
supplies him with a text to illustrate one incident after another;
and so deeply is he impressed with the correspondence between
the life of Christ and the words of ancient prophecy, that he does
not hesitate to introduce his quotations by the formula &ldquo;that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His Hebrew instinct leads him to begin with a table of genealogy,
artificially constructed in groups of fourteen generations&mdash;from
Abraham to David, from David to the Captivity, and from
the Captivity to the Christ. The royal descent of the Messiah is
thus declared, and from the outset His figure is set against the
background of the Old Testament. He then proceeds to show
that, though His lineage is traced through Joseph&rsquo;s ancestors,
He was but the adopted son of Joseph, and he tells the story of
the Virgin-birth. The coming of the Child draws Eastern sages
to his cradle and fills the court of Herod with suspicious fears.
The cruel tyrant kills the babes of Bethlehem, but the Child has
been withdrawn by a secret flight into Egypt, whence he presently
returns to the family home at Nazareth in Galilee. All this is
necessarily fresh material, for the other records had dealt only
with the period of public ministry. We have no knowledge of the
source from which it was drawn. From the historical standpoint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
its value must be appraised by the estimate which is formed of
the writer&rsquo;s general trustworthiness as a narrator, and by the
extent to which the incidents receive confirmation from other
quarters. The central fact of the Virgin-birth, as we shall
presently see, has high attestation from another early writer.</p>

<p>The next addition which St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel makes to our
knowledge is of a different kind. It consists of various important
sayings of our Lord, which are combined with discourses
found in the second document and are worked
<span class="sidenote">Discourses and Parables.</span>
up into the great utterance which we call the Sermon
on the Mount. Such grouping of materials is a feature of this
Gospel, and was possibly designed for purposes of public instruction;
so that continuous passages might be read aloud in the
services of the Church, just as passages from the Old Testament
were read in the Jewish synagogues. This motive would account
not only for the arrangement of the material, but also for certain
changes in the language which seem intended to remove difficulties,
and to interpret what is ambiguous or obscure. An example
of such interpretation meets us at the outset. The startling saying,
&ldquo;Blessed are ye poor,&rdquo; followed by the woe pronounced upon the
rich, might seem like a condemnation of the very principle of
property; and when the Christian Church had come to be organized
as a society containing rich and poor, the heart of the saying
was felt to be more truly and clearly expressed in the words,
&ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&rdquo; This interpretative process
may be traced again and again in this Gospel, which frequently
seems to reflect the definite tradition of a settled Church.</p>

<p>Apart from the important parables of the tares, the pearl and
the net, the writer adds little to his sources until we come to the
remarkable passage in ch. xvi., in which Peter the Rock is
declared to be the foundation of the future Church, and is entrusted
with the keys of the kingdom of heaven. The function
of &ldquo;binding and loosing,&rdquo; here assigned to him, is in identical
terms assigned to the disciples generally in a passage in
ch. xviii. in which for the second time we meet with the word
&ldquo;Church&rdquo;&mdash;a word not found elsewhere in the Gospels. There
is no sufficient ground for denying that these sayings were uttered
by our Lord, but the fact that they were now first placed upon
record harmonizes with what has been said already as to the
more settled condition of the Christian society which this Gospel
appears to reflect.</p>

<p>The parables of the two debtors, the labourers in the vineyard,
the two sons, the ten virgins, the sheep and goats, are recorded
only by this evangelist. But by way of incident he has almost
nothing to add till we come to the closing scenes. The earthquake
at the moment of our Lord&rsquo;s death and the subsequent
appearance of departed saints are strange traditions unattested
by other writers. The same is to be said of the soldiers placed to
guard the tomb, and of the story that they had been bribed to
say that the sacred body had been stolen while they slept. On
the other hand, the appearance of the risen Christ to the women
may have been taken from the lost pages of St Mark, being the
sequel to the narrative which is broken off abruptly in this Gospel:
and it is not improbable that St Mark&rsquo;s Gospel was the source
of the great commission to preach and baptize with which
St Matthew closes, though the wording of it has probably
been modified in accordance with a settled tradition.</p>

<p>The work which the writer of this Gospel thus performed
received the immediate sanction of a wide acceptance. It met
a definite spiritual need. It presented the Gospel in a suitable
form for the edification of the Church; and it confirmed its truth
by constant appeals to the Old Testament scriptures, thus manifesting
its intimate relation with the past as the outcome of a
long preparation and as the fulfilment of a Divine purpose. No
Gospel is so frequently quoted by the early post-apostolic writers:
none has exercised a greater influence upon Christianity, and
consequently upon the history of the world.</p>

<p>Yet from the purely historical point of view its evidential
value is not the same as that of St Mark. Its facts for the most
part are simply taken over from the earlier evangelist, and the
historian must obviously prefer the primary source. Its true
importance lies in its attestation of the genuineness of the earlier
portraits to which it has so little to add, in its recognition of the
relation of Christ to the whole purpose of God as revealed in the
Old Testament, and in its interpretation of the Gospel message
in its bearing on the living Church of the primitive days.</p>

<p>5. <i>Additions by St Luke.</i>&mdash;While the needs of Jewish believers
were amply met by St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel, a like service
was rendered to Gentile converts by a very different writer.
St Luke was a physician who had accompanied St Paul on his
missionary journeys. He undertook a history of the beginnings
of Christianity, two volumes of which have come down to us,
entitled the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. His Gospel,
like St Matthew&rsquo;s, is founded on St Mark, with the incorporation
of large portions of the second document of which we have
spoken above. But the way in which the two writers have used
the same materials is strikingly different. In St Matthew&rsquo;s
Gospel the original sources are frequently blended: the incidents
of St Mark are rearranged and often grouped afresh according
to subject matter: harsh and ambiguous sentences of both
documents are toned down or interpreted. St Luke, on the
contrary, chooses between parallel stories of his two sources,
preferring neither to duplicate nor to combine: he incorporates
St Mark in continuous sections, following him alone for a time,
then leaving him entirely, and then returning to introduce a new
block of his narrative. He modifies St Mark&rsquo;s style very freely,
but he makes less change in the recorded words of our Lord, and
he adheres more closely to the original language of the second
document.</p>

<p>In his first two chapters he gives an account of the birth and
childhood of St John the Baptist and of our Lord Himself,
gathered perhaps directly from the traditions of the Holy Family,
and written in close imitation of the sacred stories of the Old
Testament which were familiar to him in their Greek translation.
The whole series of incidents differ from that which we find in
St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel, but there is no direct variance between
them. The two narratives are in agreement as to the central fact
of the Virgin-birth. St Luke gives a table of genealogy which is
irreconcilable with the artificial table of St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel,
and which traces our Lord&rsquo;s ancestry up to Adam, &ldquo;which was
the son of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The opening scene of the Galilean ministry is the discourse at
Nazareth, in which our Lord claims to fulfil Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy
of the proclamation of good tidings to the poor. The same
prophecy is alluded to in His reply to the Baptist&rsquo;s messengers
which is incorporated subsequently from the second document.
The scene ends with the rejection of Christ by His own townsfolk,
as in the parallel story of St Mark which St Luke does not give.
It is probable that St Luke found this narrative in the second
document, and chose it after his manner in preference to the less
instructive story in St Mark. He similarly omits the Marcan
account of the call of the fishermen, substituting the story of the
miraculous draught. After that he follows St Mark alone, until
he introduces after the call of the twelve apostles the sermon
which begins with the beatitudes and woes. This is from the
second document, which he continues to use, and that without
interruption (if we may venture to assign to it the raising of the
widow&rsquo;s son at Nain and the anointing by the sinful woman in
the Pharisee&rsquo;s house), until he returns to incorporate another
section from St Mark.</p>

<p>This in turn is followed by the most characteristic section of
his Gospel (ix. 51-xviii. 14), a long series of incidents wholly
independent of St Mark, and introduced as belonging
to the period of the final journey from Galilee to
<span class="sidenote">Characteristic Section of St. Luke&rsquo;s Gospel.</span>
Jerusalem. Much of this material is demonstrably
derived from the second document; and it is quite
possible that the whole of it may come from that source.
There are special reasons for thinking so in regard to certain
passages, as for example the mission of the seventy disciples
and the parable of the good Samaritan, although they are not
contained in St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>

<p>For the closing scenes at Jerusalem St Luke makes considerable
additions to St Mark&rsquo;s narrative: he gives a different account of
the Last Supper, and he adds the trial before Herod and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
incident of the penitent robber. He appears to have had no
information as to the appearance of the risen Lord in Galilee,
and he accordingly omits from his reproduction of St Mark&rsquo;s
narrative the twice-repeated promise of a meeting with the
disciples there. He supplies, however, an account of the
appearance to the two disciples at Emmaus and to the whole
body of the apostles in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>St Luke&rsquo;s use of his two main sources has preserved the
characteristics of both of them. The sternness of certain passages,
which has led some critics to imagine that he was an Ebionite,
is mainly, if not entirely, due to his faithful reproduction of the
language of the second document. The key-note of his Gospel
is universality: the mission of the Christ embraces the poor, the
weak, the despised, the heretic and the sinful: it is good tidings
to all mankind. He tells of the devotion of Mary and Martha,
and of the band of women who ministered to our Lord&rsquo;s needs
and followed Him to Jerusalem: he tells also of His kindness to
more than one sinful woman. Zacchaeus the publican and the
grateful Samaritan leper further illustrate this characteristic.
Writing as he does for Gentile believers he omits many details
which from their strongly Jewish cast might be unintelligible or
uninteresting. He also modifies the harshness of St Mark&rsquo;s
style, and frequently recasts his language in reference to diseases.
From an historical point of view his Gospel is of high value.
The proved accuracy of detail elsewhere, as in his narration of
events which he witnessed in company with St Paul, enhances
our general estimation of his work. A trustworthy observer and a
literary artist, the one non-Jewish evangelist has given us&mdash;to use
M. Renan&rsquo;s words&mdash;&ldquo;the most beautiful book in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>6. <i>Additions by St John.</i>&mdash;We come lastly to consider what
addition to our knowledge of Christ&rsquo;s life and work is made by
the Fourth Gospel. St Mark&rsquo;s narrative of our Lord&rsquo;s ministry
and passion is so simple and straightforward that it satisfies our
historical sense. We trace a natural development in it: we seem
to see why with such power and such sympathy He necessarily
came into conflict with the religious leaders of the people,
who were jealous of the influence which He gained and were scandalized
by His refusal to be hindered in His mission of mercy
by rules and conventions to which they attached the highest
importance. The issue is fought out in Galilee, and when our Lord
finally journeys to Jerusalem He knows that He goes there to
die. The story is so plain and convincing in itself that it gives
at first sight an impression of completeness. This impression
is confirmed by the Gospels of St Matthew and St Luke, which
though they add much fresh material do not disturb the general
scheme presented by St Mark. But on reflection we are led to
question the sufficiency of the account thus offered to us. Is it
probable, we ask, that our Lord should have neglected the sacred
custom in accordance with which the pious Jew visited Jerusalem
several times each year for the observance of the divinely
appointed feasts? It is true that St Mark does not break his
narrative of the Galilean ministry to record such visits: but this
does not prove that such visits were not made. Again, is it
probable that He should have so far neglected Jerusalem as to
give it no opportunity of seeing Him and hearing His message
until the last week of His life? If the writers of the other two
Gospels had no means at their disposal for enlarging the narrow
framework of St Mark&rsquo;s narrative by recording definite visits to
Jerusalem, at least they preserve to us words from the second
document which seem to imply such visits: for how else are we
to explain the pathetic complaint, &ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how
often would I have gathered thee, as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings; but ye would not&rdquo;?</p>

<p>St John&rsquo;s Gospel meets our questionings by a wholly new
series of incidents and by an account of a ministry which is concerned
mainly not with Galileans but with Judaeans, and which
centres in Jerusalem. It is carried on to a large extent concurrently
with the Galilean ministry: it is not continuous, but is
taken up from feast to feast as our Lord visits the sacred city
at the times of its greatest religious activity. It differs in
character from the Galilean ministry: for among the simple,
unsophisticated folk of Galilee Jesus presents Himself as a healer
and helper and teacher, keeping in the background as far as
possible His claim to be the Messiah; whereas in Jerusalem His
authority is challenged at His first appearance, the element of
controversy is never absent, His relation to God is from the outset
the vital issue, and consequently His Divine claim is of necessity
made explicit. Time after time His life is threatened before
the feast is ended, and when the last passover has come we can
well understand, what was not made sufficiently clear in the
brief Marcan narrative, why Jerusalem proved so fatally hostile
to His Messianic claim.</p>

<p>The Fourth Gospel thus offers us a most important supplement
to the limited sketch of our Lord&rsquo;s life which we find in the
Synoptic Gospels. Yet this was not the purpose which
led to its composition. That purpose is plainly stated
<span class="sidenote">The Purpose of St John&rsquo;s Gospel.</span>
by the author himself: &ldquo;These things have been
written that ye may believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God, and that believing ye may have life in His name.&rdquo; His
avowed aim is, not to write history, but to produce conviction.
He desires to interpret the coming of Jesus Christ into the world,
to declare whence and why He came, and to explain how His
coming, as light in the midst of darkness, brought a crisis into
the lives of all with whom He came in contact. The issue of this
crisis in His rejection by the Jews at Jerusalem is the main theme
of the book.</p>

<p>St John&rsquo;s prologue prepares us to find that he is not writing
for persons who require a succinct narrative of facts, but for
those who having such already in familiar use are asking deep
questions as to our Lord&rsquo;s mission. It goes back far behind
human birth or lines of ancestry. It begins, like the sacred story
of creation, &ldquo;In the beginning.&rdquo; The Book of Genesis had told
how all things were called into existence by a Divine utterance:
&ldquo;God said, Let there be ... and there was.&rdquo; The creative
Word had been long personified by Jewish thought, especially
in connexion with the prophets to whom &ldquo;the Word of the Lord&rdquo;
came. &ldquo;In the beginning,&rdquo; then, St John tells us, the Word
was&mdash;was with God&mdash;yea, was God. He was the medium of
creation, the source of its light and its life&mdash;especially of that
higher life which finds its manifestation in men. So He was in
the world, and the world was made by Him, and yet the world
knew Him not. At length He came, came to the home which
had been prepared for Him, but His own people rejected Him.
But such as did receive Him found a new birth, beyond their
birth of flesh and blood: they became children of God, were
born of God. In order thus to manifest Himself He had undergone
a human birth: &ldquo;the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among
us, and we beheld His glory&rdquo;&mdash;the glory, as the evangelist has
learned to see, of the Father&rsquo;s only-begotten Son, who has
come into the world to reveal to men that God whom &ldquo;no man
hath ever seen.&rdquo; In these opening words we are invited to study
the life of Christ from a new point of view, to observe His self-manifestation
and its issue. The evangelist looks back across
a period of half a century, and writes of Christ not merely as he
saw Him in those far-off days, but as he has come by long experience
to think and speak of Him. The past is now filled with a
glory which could not be so fully perceived at the time, but
which, as St John tells, it was the function of the Holy Spirit to
reveal to Christ&rsquo;s disciples.</p>

<p>The first name which occurs in this Gospel is that of John the
Baptist. He is even introduced into the prologue which sketches
in general terms the manifestation of the Divine Word: &ldquo;There
was a man sent from God, whose name was John: he came for
witness, to witness to the Light, that through him all might
believe.&rdquo; This witness of John holds a position of high importance
in this Gospel. His mission is described as running on for
a while concurrently with that of our Lord, whereas in the other
Gospels we have no record of our Lord&rsquo;s work until John is cast
into prison. It is among the disciples of the Baptist on the
banks of the Jordan that Jesus finds His first disciples. The
Baptist has pointed Him out to them in striking language, which
recalls at once the symbolic ritual of the law and the spiritual
lessons of the prophets: &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span></p>

<p>Soon afterwards at Cana of Galilee Jesus gives His first &ldquo;sign,&rdquo;
as the evangelist calls it, in the change of water into wine to
supply the deficiency at a marriage feast. This scene has all the
happy brightness of the early Galilean ministry which St Mark
records. It stands in sharp contrast with the subsequent appearance
of Jesus in Jerusalem at the Passover, when His first act is
to drive the traders from the Temple courts. In this He seems
to be carrying the Baptist&rsquo;s stern mission of purification from the
desert into the heart of the sacred city, and so fulfilling, perhaps
consciously, the solemn prophecy of Malachi which opens with
the words: &ldquo;Behold, I will send My Messenger, and He shall
prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom ye seek shall
suddenly come to His Temple&rdquo; (Mai. iii. 1-5). This significant
action provokes a challenge of His authority, which is answered
by a mysterious saying, not understood at the time, but interpreted
afterwards as referring to the Resurrection. After this our Lord
was visited secretly by a Pharisee named Nicodemus, whose
advances were severely met by the words, &ldquo;Except a man be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; When Nicodemus
objected that this was to demand a physical impossibility,
he was answered that the new birth was &ldquo;of water and spirit&rdquo;&mdash;words
which doubtless contained a reference to the mission of the
Baptist and to his prophecy of One who should baptize with the
Holy Spirit. Towards the end of this conversation the evangelist
passes imperceptibly from reporting the words of the Lord into
an interpretation or amplification of them, and in language which
recalls the prologue he unfolds the meaning of Christ&rsquo;s mission
and indicates the crisis of self-judgment which necessarily accompanies
the manifestation of the Light to each individual.
When he resumes his narrative the Lord has left Jerusalem, and
is found baptizing disciples, in even greater numbers than the
Baptist himself. Though Jesus did not personally perform the
rite, it is plain once again that in this early period He closely
linked His own mission with that of John the Baptist. When
men hinted at a rivalry between them, John plainly declared
&ldquo;He must increase, and I must decrease&rdquo;: and the reply of Jesus
was to leave Judaea for Galilee.</p>

<p>Away from the atmosphere of contention we find Him manifesting
the same broad sympathy and freedom from convention
which we have noted in the other Gospels, especially in that of
St Luke. He converses with a woman, with a woman moreover
who is a Samaritan, and who is of unchaste life. He offers her
the &ldquo;living water&rdquo; which shall supply all her needs: she readily
accepts Him as the expected Messiah, and He receives a welcome
from the Samaritans. He passes on to Galilee, where also He
is welcomed, and where He performs His second &ldquo;sign,&rdquo; healing
the son of one of Herod&rsquo;s courtiers.</p>

<p>But St John&rsquo;s interest does not lie in Galilee, and he soon brings
our Lord back to Jerusalem on the occasion of a feast. The
Baptist&rsquo;s work is now ended; and, though Jesus still
appeals to the testimony of John, the new conflict
<span class="sidenote">The Ministry at Jerusalem.</span>
with the Jewish authorities shows that He is moving
now on His own independent and characteristic lines. In
cleansing the Temple He had given offence by what might seem
an excess of rigour: now, by healing a sick man and bidding him
carry his bed on the Sabbath, He offended by His laxity. He
answered His accusers by the brief but pregnant sentence: &ldquo;My
Father worketh even until now, and I work.&rdquo; They at once
understood that He thus claimed a unique relation to God, and
their antagonism became the more intense: &ldquo;the Jews therefore
sought the more to kill Him, because He had not only broken the
Sabbath, but had also said that God was His own Father, making
Himself equal to God.&rdquo; His first reply is then expanded to
cover the whole region of life. The Son beholds the Father at
work, and works concurrently, doing nothing of Himself. He
does the Father&rsquo;s will. The very principle of life is entrusted to
Him. He quickens, and He judges. As Son of Man He judges
man.</p>

<p>The next incident is the feeding of the five thousand, which
belongs to the Galilean ministry and is recorded by the three
other evangelists. St John&rsquo;s purpose in introducing it is not historical
but didactic. It is made the occasion of instruction as to
the heavenly food, the flesh and blood of Him who came down
from heaven. This teaching leads to a conflict with certain
Judaeans who seem to have come from Jerusalem, and it proves
a severe test even to the faith of disciples.</p>

<p>The feast of tabernacles brings fresh disputes in Jerusalem,
and an attempt is made to arrest Jesus. A climax of indignation
is reached when a blind man is healed at the pool of Siloam on the
sabbath day. At the feast of the dedication a fresh effort at
arrest was made, and Jesus then withdrew beyond the Jordan.
Here He learned of the sickness of Lazarus, and presently He
returned and came to Bethany to raise him from the dead. The
excitement produced by this miracle led to yet another attack,
destined this time to be successful, on the life of Jesus. The
Passover was at hand, and the last supper of our Lord with His
disciples on the evening before the Passover lamb was killed is
made the occasion of the most inspiring consolations. Our Lord
interprets His relation to the disciples by the figure of a tree and
its branches&mdash;He is the whole of which they are the parts; He
promises the mission of the Holy Spirit to continue His work
in the world; and He solemnly commends to His Father the disciples
whom He is about to leave.</p>

<p>The account of the trial and the crucifixion differs considerably
from the accounts given in the other Gospels. St John&rsquo;s narratives
are in large part personal memories, and in more than one
incident he himself figures as the unnamed disciple &ldquo;whom Jesus
loved.&rdquo; In the Resurrection scenes he also gives incidents in
which he has played a part; and the appearances of the risen
Lord are not confined either to Jerusalem or to Galilee, but occur
in both localities.</p>

<p>If we ask what is the special contribution to history, apart
from theology, which St John&rsquo;s Gospel makes, the answer would
seem to be this&mdash;that beside the Galilean ministry reported by
St Mark there was a ministry to &ldquo;Jews&rdquo; (Judaeans) in Jerusalem,
not continuous, but occasional, taken up from time to time
as the great feasts came round; that its teaching was widely
different from that which was given to Galileans, and that the
situation created was wholly unlike that which arose out of the
Galilean ministry. The Galilean ministry opens with enthusiasm,
ripening into a popularity which even endangers a satisfactory
result. Where opposition manifests itself, it is not
native opposition, but comes from religious teachers who are
parts of a system which centres in Jerusalem, and who are sometimes
expressly noted as having come from Jerusalem. The
Jerusalem ministry on the contrary is never welcomed with
enthusiasm. It has to do with those who challenge it from the
first. There is no atmosphere of simplicity and teachableness
which rejoices in the manifestation of power and sympathy and
liberty. It is a witness delivered to a hostile audience, whether
they will hear or no. Ultimate issues are quickly raised: keen
critics see at once the claims which underlie deeds and words,
and the claims in consequence become explicit: the relation of
the teacher to God Himself is the vital interest. The conflict
which thus arose explains what St Mark&rsquo;s succinct narrative had
left unexplained&mdash;the fatal hostility of Jerusalem. It may have
been a part of St John&rsquo;s purpose to give this explanation, and to
make other supplements or corrections where earlier narratives
appeared to him incomplete or misleading. But he says nothing
to indicate this, while on the other hand he distinctly proclaims
that his purpose is to produce and confirm conviction of the divine
claims of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JET<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (Fr. <i>jais</i>, Ger. <i>Gagat</i>), a substance which seems to be
a peculiar kind of lignite or anthracite; often cut and polished
for ornaments. The word &ldquo;jet&rdquo; probably comes, through O. Fr.
<i>jaiet</i>, from the classical <i>gagates</i>, a word which was derived,
according to Pliny, from Gagas, in Lycia, where jet, or a similar
substance, was originally found. Jet was used in Britain in
prehistoric times; many round barrows of the Bronze age have
yielded jet beads, buttons, rings, armlets and other ornaments.
The abundance of jet in Britain is alluded to by Caius Julius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
Solinus (<i>fl.</i> 3rd century) and jet ornaments are found with Roman
relics in Britain. Probably the supply was obtained from the
coast of Yorkshire, especially near Whitby, where nodules of jet
were formerly picked up on the shore. Caedmon refers to this
jet, and at a later date it was used for rosary beads by the monks
of Whitby Abbey.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Whitby jet occurs in irregular masses, often of lenticular
shape, embedded in hard shales known as jet-rock. The jet-rock
series belongs to that division of the Upper Lias which is termed
the zone of <i>Ammonites serpentinus</i>. Microscopic examination of
jet occasionally reveals the structure of coniferous wood, which
A. C. Seward has shown to be araucarian. Probably masses of
wood were brought down by a river, and drifted out to sea, where
becoming water-logged they sank, and became gradually buried in
a deposit of fine mud, which eventually hardened into shale. Under
pressure, perhaps assisted by heat, and with exclusion of air, the
wood suffered a peculiar kind of decomposition, probably modified
by the presence of salt water, as suggested by Percy E. Spielmann.
Scales of fish and other fossils of the jet-rock are frequently impregnated
with bituminous products, which may replace the original
tissues. Drops of liquid bitumen occur in the cavities of some
fossils, whilst inflammable gas is not uncommon in the jet-workings,
and petroleum may be detected by its smell. Iron pyrites is often
associated with the jet.</p>

<p>Formerly sufficient jet was found in loose pieces on the shore, set
free by the disintegration of the cliffs, or washed up from a submarine
source. When this supply became insufficient, the rock was attacked
by the jet-workers; ultimately the workings took the form of true
mines, levels being driven into the shales not only at their outcrop
in the cliffs but in some of the inland dales of the Yorkshire moorlands,
such as Eskdale. The best jet has a uniform black colour,
and is hard, compact and homogeneous in texture, breaking with a
conchoidal fracture. It must be tough enough to be readily carved
or turned on the lathe, and sufficiently compact in texture to receive
a high polish. The final polish was formerly given by means of
rouge, which produces a beautiful velvety surface, but rotten-stone
and lampblack are often employed instead. The softer kinds, not
capable of being freely worked, are known as bastard jet. A soft
jet is obtained from the estuarine series of the Lower Oolites of
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Much jet is imported from Spain, but it is generally less hard and
lustrous than true Whitby jet. In Spain the chief locality is
Villaviciosa, in the province of Asturias. France furnishes jet,
especially in the department of the Aude. Much jet, too, occurs in
the Lias of Württemberg, and works have been established for its
utilization. In the United States jet is known at many localities
but is not systematically worked. Pennsylvanian anthracite,
however, has been occasionally employed as a substitute. In like
manner Scotch cannel coal has been sometimes used at Whitby.
Imitations of jet, or substitutes for it, are furnished by vulcanite,
glass, black obsidian and black onyx, or stained chalcedony. Jet
is sometimes improperly termed black amber, because like amber,
though in less degree, it becomes electric by friction.</p>

<p><span class="bold">JETHRO<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Jether</span>, Exod. iv. 18), the priest of Midian, in the
Bible, whose daughter Zipporah became the wife of Moses. He is
known as Hobab the son of Reuel the Kenite (Num. x. 29; Judg.
iv. 11 ), and once as Reuel (Exod. ii. 18); and if Zipporah is the wife
of Moses referred to in Num. xii. 1, the family could be regarded
as Cushite (see Cush). Jethro was the priest of Yahweh, and
resided at the sacred mountain where the deity commissioned
Moses to deliver the Israelites from Egypt. Subsequently
Jethro came to Moses (probably at Kadesh), a great sacrificial
feast was held, and the priest instructed Moses in legislative
procedure; Exod. xviii. 27 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Exodus</a></span>) and Num. x. 30 imply
that the scene was not Sinai. Jethro was invited to accompany
the people into the promised land, and later, we find his clan
settling in the south of Judah (Judg. i. 16); see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kenites</a></span>. The
traditions agree in representing the kin of Moses as related to
the mixed tribes of the south of Palestine (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Edom</a></span>) and in
ascribing to the family an important share in the early development
of the worship of Yahweh. Cheyne suggests that the
names of Hobab and of Jonadab the father of the Rechabites
(<i>q.v.</i>) were originally identical (<i>Ency. Bib.</i> ii. col. 2101).</p>

<p><span class="bold">JETTY.<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> The term jetty, derived from Fr. <i>jetée</i>, and therefore
signifying something &ldquo;thrown out,&rdquo; is applied to a variety of
structures employed in river, dock and maritime works, which
are generally carried out in pairs from river banks, or in continuation
of river channels at their outlets into deep water; or out into
docks, and outside their entrances; or for forming basins along
the sea-coast for ports in tideless seas. The forms and construction
of these jetties are as varied as their uses; for though they
invariably extend out into water, and serve either for directing
a current or for accommodating vessels, they are sometimes
formed of high open timber-work, sometimes of low solid projections,
and occasionally only differ from breakwaters in their
object.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Jetties for regulating Rivers.</i>&mdash;Formerly jetties of timber-work were
very commonly extended out, opposite one another, from each bank
of a river, at intervals, to contract a wide channel, and by concentration
of the current to produce a deepening of the central channel; or
sometimes mounds of rubble stone, stretching down the foreshore
from each bank, served the same purpose. As, however, this system
occasioned a greater scour between the ends of the jetties than in
the intervening channels, and consequently produced an irregular
depth, it has to a great extent been superseded by longitudinal
training works, or by dipping cross dikes pointing somewhat upstream
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">River Engineering</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Jetties at Docks.</i>&mdash;Where docks are given sloping sides, openwork
timber jetties are generally carried across the slope, at the ends of
which vessels can lie in deep water (fig. 1); or more solid structures
are erected over the slope for supporting coal-tips. Pilework jetties
are also constructed in the water outside the entrances to docks on
each side, so as to form an enlarging trumpet-shaped channel
between the entrance, lock or tidal basin and the approach channel,
in order to guide vessels in entering or leaving the docks. Solid
jetties, moreover, lined with quay walls, are sometimes carried out
into a wide dock, at right angles to the line of quays at the side, to
enlarge the accommodation; and they also serve, when extended on
a large scale from the coast of a tideless sea under shelter of an outlying
breakwater, to form the basins in which vessels lie when
discharging and taking in cargoes in such a port as Marseilles (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dock</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Jetties at Entrances to Jetty Harbours.</i>&mdash;The approach channel to
some ports situated on sandy coasts is guided and protected across
the beach by parallel jetties, made solid up to a little above low water
of neap tides, on which open timber-work is erected, provided with
a planked platform at the top raised above the highest tides. The
channel between the jetties was originally maintained by tidal scour
from low-lying areas close to the coast, and subsequently by the
current from sluicing basins; but it is now often considerably
deepened by sand-pump dredging. It is protected to some extent
by the solid portion of the jetties from the inroad of sand from the
adjacent beach, and from the levelling action of the waves; whilst
the upper open portion serves to indicate the channel, and to guide
the vessels if necessary (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harbour</a></span>). The bottom part of the
older jetties, in such long-established jetty ports as Calais, Dunkirk
and Ostend, was composed of clay or rubble stone, covered on the
top by fascine-work or pitching; but the deepening of the jetty
channel by dredging, and the need which arose for its enlargement,
led to the reconstruction of the jetties at these ports. The new
jetties at Dunkirk were founded in the sandy beach, by the aid of
compressed air, at a depth of 22¾ ft. below low water of spring
tides; and their solid masonry portion, on a concrete foundation,
was raised 5<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> ft. above low water of neap tides (fig. 2).</p>

<p><i>Jetties at Lagoon Outlets.</i>&mdash;A small tidal rise spreading tidal water
over a large expanse of lagoon or inland back-water causes the influx
and efflux of the tide to maintain a deep channel through a narrow
outlet; but the issuing current on emerging from the outlet, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
no longer confined by a bank on each side, becomes dispersed, and
owing to the reduction of its scouring force, is no longer able at a
moderate distance from the shore
effectually to resist the action of
the waves and littoral currents
tending to form a continuous beach
in front of the outlet. Hence a
bar is produced which diminishes
the available depth in the approach
channel. By carrying out
a solid jetty over the bar, however,
on each side of the outlet, the tidal
currents are concentrated in the
channel across the bar, and lower it
by scour. Thus the available depth
of the approach channels to Venice
through the Malamocco and Lido
outlets from the Venetian lagoon
have been deepened several feet
over their bars by jetties of rubble
stone surmounted by a small superstructure
(fig. 3), carried out across
the foreshore into deep water on
both sides of the channel. Other examples are provided by the long
jetties extended into the sea in front of the entrance to Charleston
harbour, formerly constructed of fascines, weighted with stone and
logs, but subsequently of rubble stone, and by the two converging
rubble jetties carried out from each shore of Dublin bay for deepening
the approach to Dublin harbour.</p>

<p><i>Jetties at the Outlet of Tideless
Rivers.</i>&mdash;Jetties have been constructed
on each side of the outlet
of some of the rivers flowing into
the Baltic, with the objects of
prolonging the scour of the river
and protecting the channel from
being shoaled by the littoral drift
along the shore. The most interesting
application of parallel
jetties is in lowering the bar in
front of one of the mouths of a
deltaic river flowing into a tideless
sea, by extending the scour
of the river out to the bar by
a virtual prolongation of its
banks. Jetties prolonging the
Sulina branch of the Danube
into the Black Sea, and the
south pass of the Mississippi
into the Gulf of Mexico (fig. 4), formed of rubble stone
and concrete blocks, and
fascine mattresses weighted
with stone and surmounted
with large concrete blocks
respectively, have enabled the
discharge of these rivers to
scour away the bars obstructing
the access to them;
and they have also carried
the sediment-bearing waters
sufficiently far out to come
under the influence of littoral
currents, which, by conveying away some of the sediment, postpone
the eventual formation of a fresh bar farther out (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">River
Engineering</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Jetties at the Mouth of Tidal Rivers.</i>&mdash;Where a river is narrow near
its mouth, and its discharge is generally feeble, the sea is liable on
an exposed coast, when the tidal range is small, to block up its outlet
during severe storms. The river is thus forced to seek another exit
at a weak spot of the beach, which along a low coast may be at some
distance off; and this new outlet in its turn may be blocked up, so
that the river from time to time shifts the position of its mouth.
This inconvenient cycle of changes may be stopped by fixing the
outlet of the river at a suitable site, by carrying a jetty on each side
of this outlet across the beach, thereby concentrating its discharge
in a definite channel and protecting the mouth from being blocked
up by littoral drift. This system was long ago applied to the
shifting outlet of the river Yare to the south of Yarmouth, and has
also been successfully employed for fixing the wandering mouth of
the Adur near Shoreham, and of the Adour flowing into the Bay of
Biscay below Bayonne. When a new channel was cut across the
Hook of Holland to provide a straighter and deeper outlet channel
for the river Maas, forming the approach channel to Rotterdam, low,
broad, parallel jetties, composed of fascine mattresses weighted with
stone (fig. 5), were carried across the foreshore into the sea on either
side of the new mouth of the river, to protect the jetty channel from
littoral drift, and cause the discharge of the river to maintain it
out to deep water (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">River Engineering</a></span>). The channel, also,
beyond the outlet of the river Nervion into the Bay of Biscay has
been regulated by jetties; and by extending the south-west jetty
out for nearly half a mile with a curve concave towards the channel
the outlet has not only been protected to some extent from the
easterly drift, but the bar in front has been lowered by the scour
produced by the discharge of the river following the concave bend
of the south-west jetty. As the outer portion of this jetty was
exposed to westerly storms from the Bay of Biscay before the outer
harbour was constructed, it has been given the form and strength
of a breakwater situated in shallow water (fig. 6).</p>
